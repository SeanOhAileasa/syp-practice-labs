<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m7-96"><b>Exercise 1 - Actors and Threats</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-97">Threat actors are the entities who are the originators of the threats. Threat actor can be:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-98">

<li id="cn-m7-98">Internal, such as disgruntled employees</li>

<li id="cn-m7-99">Malicious intruders, such as hackers</li>

<li id="cn-m7-100">Natural disasters, such as floods</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-101">Threat actors can be individuals or groups. These can 
range from a script kiddie that uses scripts developed by someone, to 
someone who is highly expert in conducting attacks, such as a 
nation-state. A script kiddie would be low skilled, but a nation-state 
would use highly advanced methods of conducting attacks.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-102">In this exercise, you will learn about threats, actors, and their attributes.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-104">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-105">

<li id="cn-m7-105">Actors, Their Attributes, and Threats</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Device</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-107">This exercise contains supporting materials for Security+.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-108"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-1" src="GatheringIntelligenceonThreatActorsandVectors_files/image-m7-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-109"><b>Actors, Their Attributes, and Threats&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-110">There can be different types of threat actors. Each 
threat actor can have different attributes, which are their 
characteristics, features or methods of attacks. For example, a threat 
actor can be characterized as internal or external. An internal threat 
actor is someone who is an employee or part of an organization. An 
internal threat is also known as an insider threat, which is covered 
later in the exercise.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-111">An external threat actor is someone who conducts an 
attack from outside the organization. They are characterized to be 
dangerous and extremely skillful. Each type of external threat actor has
 a level of sophistication and uses different threat vectors that 
include processes and tools. It is also important to note that the 
threat actors, specifically the external ones, are well-funded and 
resourceful. They have either their custom tools or use the tools 
borrowed from other hacker groups. For example, the Anonymous group is 
one of the big hacktivist groups that use a third-party tool named Low 
Orbit Ion Cannon&nbsp;(LOIC) for conducting Distributed 
Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m7-112"><b><i>Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-113">In a traditional attack, a hacker gets into the 
system, does the damage, and moves out. However, APT attacks are 
different. The attacker gains access to the system or network and stays 
there for a long time. The security controls fail to detect APT attacks.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-114">Unlike the traditional attack, which may cause damage 
to the system or network and get detected in a short period, the APT 
attacks quietly keep exfiltrating the data without being detected. The 
APT attacks usually do not cause damage and therefore, do not attract 
attention. Since there are no noticeable activities within the systems 
or the network, these attacks go unnoticed and manage to exist within 
the network or system for a long time.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-115">APT attacks have several characteristics that set them apart from traditional threats:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-116">

<li id="cn-m7-116">Well-targeted</li>

<li id="cn-m7-117">Data focused</li>

<li id="cn-m7-118">Looks for high-value information</li>

<li id="cn-m7-119">Un-detectable</li>

<li id="cn-m7-120">Well organized</li>

<li id="cn-m7-121">Well-funded</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-122">People conducting APTs are highly skilled and use sophisticated methods. They look for valuable information, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-123">

<li id="cn-m7-123">intellectual property (IP) secrets</li>

<li id="cn-m7-124">design</li>

<li id="cn-m7-125">critical business information</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-126">It is not necessary that the APTs only focus on the 
large organization for data. They can also target political parties and 
even nations. With the nations, they can target critical 
infrastructures, such as the power grid or the nuclear facilities.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-127">The process that ATP follows:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-128">

<li id="cn-m7-128">Define and research targets</li>

<li id="cn-m7-129">Complete initial intrustions</li>

<li id="cn-m7-130">Compromise user credentials</li>

<li id="cn-m7-131">Move laterally</li>

<li id="cn-m7-132">Keep a low profile and build a stron foothold</li>

<li id="cn-m7-133">Exfiltrate data</li>

<li id="cn-m7-134">Cover your tracks</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m7-135"><b><i>Insider threats</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-136">Insider threats are generated by the individuals who 
are either the organization's employees or are closely associated with 
the organization as a vendor or third-party. It is difficult to detect 
insider threats because insiders are virtually difficult to detect as 
attackers.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-137">Consider an example where the attacker tried to hack 
into your network. There are various security controls, such as a 
firewall, blocking access. However, in the insider's case, they do not 
have to face the perimeter security or the security controls configured 
on the edge of the network. The insiders are already inside the network 
and have access to the various resources on the network.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-138">The insiders are usually not seen as a threat to the 
organization’s resources. They have legitimate access to the resources 
that exist on the network. Several insiders may have more than the 
required access, meaning they can access and exploit the weaknesses that
 may exist within the network and its resources.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-139"><b>Types of Insiders</b></p>

<p id="cn-m7-140">There are different types of insiders:</p>

<p id="cn-m7-141"><b>Pure Insider</b></p>

<p id="cn-m7-142">A pure insider is a person who is part of the 
organization and is a legitimate user. The pure insider has permissions 
and privileges to the internal network and the resources utilized by the
 organization. Hence, they are able to connect to the network and access
 the resources in the organization. This gives them the capability to 
cause maximum damage.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-144"><b>Insider Associate</b></p>

<p id="cn-m7-145">An insider associate is someone who is not directly 
part of the organization, but he or she is a third-party vendor or a 
contractor. The insider associate can also be the security guard or even
 a receptionist who can be a contractual resource. They can have limited
 access to the network resources or even the facility where your 
organization has the office. For example, a security guard may simply 
have access to the papers that are left out, unattended on the 
employees’ desk. Some of the papers may contain confidential 
information. This information can now be passed on to a malicious 
entity.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-146"><b>Insider Affiliate</b></p>

<p id="cn-m7-147">An insider affiliate is someone who can be a spouse, 
friend, or acquaintance of an employee. This person can obtain the 
information, such as user credentials or a security badge from the 
employee and access the network or even the facility.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-148"><b>Outsider Affiliate</b></p>

<p id="cn-m7-149">Outside affiliates are external entities, which are 
not employees or do not have a connection with an employee. The outsider
 affiliate can attempt to find entry into the facility or the network 
using different methods. It could be through obtaining credentials of an
 individual or breaking into a wireless network and gaining access to 
the network.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-150">There can be two types of insider threats:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-151">

<li id="cn-m7-151">Intentional</li>

<li id="cn-m7-152">Unintentional</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-153"><b>Intentional</b></p>

<p id="cn-m7-154">These can be insiders who have access to the internal 
network and its resources. They are the entities who have the 
opportunity to conduct malicious intent. In some cases, these entities 
have access to confidential and restricted information. An example can 
be a personal assistant to the organization's CEO, who would have access
 to various resources, such as their Email or budgets etc.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-155">If the secretary decided to sell the CEO/company’s 
confidential information, or someone simply triggers them to share the 
information, then this would be an intentional insider threat.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-156">These insiders could be driven by motivations such as 
anger, revenge, ideology, divided loyalty, or even the work that they 
are doing. Another motive could be for personal gains, such as monetary.
 They may steal the information and sell it to outsiders, for instance 
competitors.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-157">In this scenario, if the secretary steals and shares 
the information to a malicious entity, the entire set of security 
controls within the organization network or on its perimeter network 
becomes useless.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-158"><b>Unintentional</b></p>

<p id="cn-m7-159">Unintentional insiders are the ones who do not have 
any malicious intentions but accidentally become a threat to the network
 and its resources. It is important to understand that even though it is
 unintentional their activities can be malicious, having dire 
consequences.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-160">Some of the unintentional activities they may perform are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-161">

<li id="cn-m7-161">Accidental data deletion</li>

<li id="cn-m7-162">Accidental data modification</li>

<li id="cn-m7-163">Incorrect usage of privileges</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-164">The consequences of an unintentional act can be as 
dangerous as intentional ones. For example, if a healthcare professional
 makes incorrect modifications to various patients’ data, it is 
considered a serious mistake. The doctor may end up giving the wrong 
medication to the patient based on the data shown on the system. This 
kind of unintentional attack may occur due to lack of attention, but the
 consequences can be detrimental.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m7-165"><b><i>State Actors</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-166">Nation-states are known for their cyber espionage 
against the nations. They are hired by one nations government to conduct
 an attack against the government of another nation. These are hackers 
who have sophisticated methods and techniques that they use to conduct 
the attacks and can target some of the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-167">

<li id="cn-m7-167">Government agencies</li>

<li id="cn-m7-168">Critical infrastructure</li>

<li id="cn-m7-169">Industries with sensitive data or property</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-170">In most cases, the nation-state hackers use custom 
tools and target the zero-day vulnerabilities and other vulnerabilities 
that have been known but are still present in the application and 
operating system. One of the nation-state's key attributes is that they 
are highly covert and therefore, most of the attacks conducted by them 
rarely come into the news. They, however, are highly focused and have a 
set target whom they exploit. Please see the reading list below for 
real-life examples of said attacks carried out.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-172">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="cn-m7-173"><b><i>Hacktivists</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-174">A hacktivist is a hacker who performs hacking for 
either a political reason or wants to bring in a social change. A 
hacktivist may perform a hacking due to the ideological difference with 
the government or a political party. The hacktivist performed the 
attacks to gain attention towards their ideology or highlight their 
intention of social change. In most basic terms, you can call them the 
Internet version of activists.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-175">A hacktivist can also be part of a group that acts as a
 team. They often use simple methods of attacks. Distributed Denial of 
Service or DDoS or DoS is often a key method of attacking the 
government’s Web infrastructure, such as government portals.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-176">Most famous hacktivist groups:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-177">

<li id="cn-m7-177"><b>Anonymous</b>: Known for famous attacks, such as 
the Fine Gael website, Operation Tunisia, Operation Egypt, Operation 
Syria, Operation DarkNet, AntiSec Leak, and CIA attack.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-178"><b>LulzSec</b>: Known for famous attacks, such as the Sony data breach and Sony PlayStation Network hack.</li>

</ul>

<span class="cn-quote" id="cn-m7-179"><b><i>Reading Reference:</i></b><br><i>https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/hacktivism-101-a-brief-history-of-notable-incidents</i></span>

<h4 id="cn-m7-180"><b><i>Script kiddies&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-181">A script kiddie is someone who does not have a 
hacker's expertise and relies on ready-made tools to write the code. Due
 to a lack of expertise, their attacks are generally not sophisticated.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m7-182"><b><i>Criminal syndicates</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-183">Criminal syndicates are also known as organized crime 
leaders. Organized crime turns out to be one of the biggest threats on 
the Internet. Unlike some hackers, who are into hacking for either fun 
or causing some level of damage, the organized crime hackers are serious
 criminals. They have moved away from the traditional crimes to hacking 
in cyberspace. Organized criminals are individuals who are multi-skilled
 and have sophisticated methods in conducting their attacks.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-184">The hackers conducting organized crime are no novices 
with basic tools in conducting the attacks. Rather, these guys are into 
causing serious damage to the organizations, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-185">

<li id="cn-m7-185">Extorting money using ransomware</li>

<li id="cn-m7-186">Stealing intellectual property</li>

<li id="cn-m7-187">Stealing industrial secrets and confidential organizational information</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-188">They use sophisticated tools, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-189">

<li id="cn-m7-189">Botnets</li>

<li id="cn-m7-190">Automated exploit kits</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m7-191"><b><i>Hackers&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-192">By default, when you hear the term ‘Hacker’, you think
 of a shady person who is usually involved in breaking computers. This 
is a popular perception however, this perception of hackers is not 
completely true.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-193">A hacker can be good or bad, depending on the tasks 
they perform and the intentions he or she has. Broadly, the hackers are 
categorized into three different types:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-194">

<li id="cn-m7-194">White Hat Hackers</li>

<li id="cn-m7-195">Black Hat Hackers</li>

<li id="cn-m7-196">Grey Hat Hackers</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-197"><b>White Hat Hackers</b>: Have deep technical skills 
in which they use to prevent the system from breaking rather than 
breaking them. This means that they find the flaws in the systems and 
help the organization fix these flaws. White Hat Hackers, also known as 
Ethical Hackers, are either consultants or on the organization's 
payroll. They are responsible for performing penetration testing and 
vulnerability assessment. They limit themselves with only finding the 
vulnerabilities and flaws but not exploit them. They are supposed to 
inform the organization of any vulnerabilities found. One of the key 
points about White Hat Hackers is that they perform the tests with the 
organization's permissions.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-198"><b>Black Hat Hackers</b>: Just like the White Hat 
Hackers, the Black Hat Hackers also have deep technical expertise. They 
are not people with good intentions, but they break into the systems for
 personal or financial gain. These hackers are breaking and damaging 
systems, which could be stealing valuable information, erasing data, 
stealing intellectual property and harassing or stalking someone. Black 
Hat Hackers do not work with the commercial tools. They would either 
write their malware or security tools or use other hackers’ tools. For 
example, a hacker may simply rent an exploit kit or purchase a license. 
Serenity exploit kit can be purchased. Hacking Tools is another exploit 
kit that is easily available on GitHub.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-199">URL: https://github.com/Z4nzu/hackingtool</p>

<p id="cn-m7-200">However, the majority of exploit kits are not 
available on the Internet. Their authors or owners have websites on the 
Dark Web, and these websites are not indexed on search engines like 
Google.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-201"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-2" src="GatheringIntelligenceonThreatActorsandVectors_files/image-m7-c-2.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1 Diagram showing Hacking Tool"><figcaption>Figure 1.1 Diagram showing Hacking Tool: Showing various tools included in the Hacking Tool.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m7-203"><b>Grey Hat Hackers</b>: Grey Hat Hackers are a 
combination of Black and White Hat Hackers. The Black Hat Hacker 
qualities consist of breaking into systems without the owner’s 
permission. The White Hat Hacker qualities consist of finding the 
vulnerabilities and informing the owner. They are usually on the lookout
 for some type of monetary reward. If the owner does not pay the reward,
 they may sell the vulnerabilities to other hackers or even put them 
online.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m7-204"><b><i>Shadow IT</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-205">Consider a scenario in which your organization has 
several strict security controls implemented. Being a developer, you 
need to frequently test your applications, which the network does not 
allow due to security controls. You set up a small network of multiple 
desktops and a switch, and continue with the application testing. The IT
 team is unaware of this setup. You have now performed the role of 
shadow IT.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-206">Shadow IT works to circumvent or work around the 
bottlenecks that they face on the network. As in the given example, you 
could not find a way to test your applications and, therefore, set up 
your network. So, to circumvent the network's security controls, you set
 up your network to test applications. In a way, you have used the IT 
resources to beat their security controls.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m7-207"><b><i>Competitors</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-208">Often competitors of an organization hire hackers to 
penetrate its network. For example, organization 1 might pay a hacker to
 penetrate the organization 2 networks and steal valuable information. 
Alternatively, the competitor organization may also get hold of an 
insider to provide confidential information. Assume that there is a 
frustrated employee, but he has a good amount of confidential 
information. The possibility is that he will approach the competitor to 
sell the information, or if the competitor finds out about such an 
employee, they might approach him. It is easy to get the information 
from an insider rather than hire a hacker who may or may not get the 
information you need.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m7-211"><b>Exercise 2 - Threat Vectors</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-212">A threat agent is someone who conducts an attack. 
Threat agents can use various methods in an attack. For example, a 
threat actor can exploit a vulnerability in an attack. The methods or 
techniques used by the threat actor are known as the threat vectors.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-213">A threat actor can use different types of attack 
vectors. For example, a threat actor can simply exploit the 
vulnerabilities. Another threat actor may use social engineering methods
 to get into an organization.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-214">Some of the key examples of threat vector are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-215">

<li id="cn-m7-215">Unpatched vulnerabilities</li>

<li id="cn-m7-216">Brute force/cracking</li>

<li id="cn-m7-217">Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</li>

<li id="cn-m7-218">Domain Shadowing or hijacking</li>

<li id="cn-m7-219">Credential reuse</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-220">In this exercise, you will learn about various threat vectors.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-222">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-223">

<li id="cn-m7-224">Wireless</li>

<li id="cn-m7-225">Email</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Device</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-231">This exercise contains supporting materials for Security+.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-232"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-3" src="GatheringIntelligenceonThreatActorsandVectors_files/image-m7-c-3.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-233"><b>Direct Access</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-234">It is common for the network administrators to expose 
the Webservers and other network devices to the Internet. Anyone with 
the appropriate permissions can access the systems and devices. When 
there is direct access available on the Internet, it also lures hackers 
to break into the system. For example, a hacker may simply launch a 
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack to bring down the system or 
even attempt to break the password. One possible solution is to put the 
systems and devices behind Network Access Translation (NAT) to prevent 
them from being visible on the Internet.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-235"><b>Wireless</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-236">A wireless network is found in almost all 
organizations. If not secured properly, a wireless network may simply 
become the entry point into a network. For example, an unsecured 
wireless hotspots can be easily compromised and then lead the attacker 
right into the network.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-237"><b>Email</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-238">Everyone uses Emails. There are billions of emails 
being sent and received by individuals. A research study by Verizon 
concluded that 94% of the malware was delivered by Email. Another 
research study by Check Point mentions that 64% of the organizations 
have been victims of phishing attacks.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-239">Please see the below example:</p>

<p id="cn-m7-240"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-4" src="GatheringIntelligenceonThreatActorsandVectors_files/image-m7-c-4.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 Screenshot of PLABWIN10"><figcaption>Figure
 2.1 Screenshot of PLABWIN10: Showing the browser window and simulated 
email message.  The lower-left corner shows the actual link URL for the 
link embedded in the message above.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m7-241">The above is an example of a malicious email. Attached
 to the email is an executable file, when executed by an unsuspecting 
user, may result in the installation of malware on the user’s computer.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-242">In the email body, there is also an URL link, closely 
examining the link shows that it is not a valid link to the Bank’s 
website. When a user unsuspectingly clicks on the link, it will redirect
 the user to a fake site where the user might divulge sensitive 
information that can be used by the attacker for a further exploit.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-243">For more information, refer to the following URL: https://www.phishingbox.com/resources/phishing-facts</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-244"><b>Supply Chain</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-245">A supply chain involves several entities, right from 
the producer organization, supplier and customer, to the product's 
end-user. Several steps are performed in a supply chain. At each step, 
it is possible to let some of the steps go unsupervised.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-246">In a real incident in 2008, a supply chain infection 
had a major impact on an organization, which had produced digital photo 
frames that had been infected with a virus. When a user inserted the USB
 drive to copy files onto the digital photo frame, the virus would copy 
itself to the USB drive. Later, when the USB drive was attached to a 
system, the virus would copy itself. The result was that the 
organization had to remove the product from the market.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-247">Another good case in this context is the Android 
devices. There have been cases where the Android was infected with 
malware inserted into the device during the supply chain process. Such 
devices are released in the market, and the end-user does not know that 
there is a malware, which may be designed to steal the users 
information. If such an infected device connects to the network, the 
malware can spread further.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-248"><b>Social Media</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-249">Users often put several personal details on their 
social media accounts and make it public. For example, you may add your 
date of birth, mobile number and the place you live to a social media 
site but leave it to be publicly visible. Hackers often scan social 
media accounts of their targets to gain more information. For example, 
hackers may use this information and gain access to your email and 
social media accounts.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-250">In social media, account takeover or several other 
types of attacks are possible. Some of the common attacks using social 
media information are social engineering, social phishing, and 
impersonation.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-251">Refer to the URL for interesting reading: 
https://www.bc.net/sites/www.bc.net/files/bcnet/NewsEvents/ConferenceArchives/2017Conference/Presentations/2017Conference-Presentations-SocialThreats.pdf</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-252"><b>Removable Media</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-253">Users use a removable media, such as a USB drive, to 
copy files from one system to another. If the USB drive is infected with
 malware, there are high chances that the system to which it is plugged 
in will also be infected.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-254">The infection of USB drives is not a new phenomenon. 
In the year 2008, USB had become pretty common, and that was the same 
year when they were used as an attack vector. Over the years, the USB 
drives were continued to be used as an attack vector, but with different
 types of malware that caused different types of damages.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-255"><b>Cloud</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-256">Just like any other medium, a cloud environment can 
also serve as a threat vector. A threat actor can use an unsecured cloud
 system and turn it into a bot. There can be cloud malware injection. If
 a cloud system is compromised, then it can be used to launch various 
types of attacks, such as DDoS. It can also be possible for a threat 
actor to use a public cloud to attack an on-premise data center. It is 
important to note that cloud systems and applications also have 
vulnerabilities. If a threat actor finds the vulnerabilities, then they 
can be exploited.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-260">To be able to tackle threats, you need to know threat 
intelligence sources, which can provide up-to-date information. There is
 no single method that can be considered as the ONLY source of threat 
intelligence. To be a defender of your network, you need to ensure that 
you use various threat intelligence sources together to tackle threats.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-261">In this exercise, you will learn about various threat intelligence sources.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-263">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-264">

<li id="cn-m7-264">Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)</li>

<li id="cn-m7-265">Closed/Proprietary</li>

<p id="cn-m7-275"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-5" src="GatheringIntelligenceonThreatActorsandVectors_files/image-m7-c-5.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-277"><b>Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-278">Open-source intelligence or OSINT is conducted on the 
content or information that is free to use and is in the public domain. 
You can find data or information available and use it for various 
purposes, such as analysis. In the security domain, open-source 
intelligence is about using tools and techniques to find information. It
 is important to understand that anything that can be found by the 
security professionals; can also be found by hackers or any kind of 
threat actor.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-279">Therefore, as a security professional, you should have
 a strategy to perform open-source intelligence to find the information 
beneficial to any threat actor. You should locate and remove such 
information from the public domain.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-280">OSINT is part of the Reconnaissance phase, and it 
helps you collect important information from public sources. A threat 
actor has a clear plan in mind to find information about an identified 
target and can be searched from different sources. However, one of the 
key issues with OSINT information is that you, as the threat actor, may 
end with a wide variety and quantity of information. This may delay the 
process because the more information you find, the more time you spend 
filtering and finding the relevant information.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-281">There are different phases in OSINT. These are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-282">

<li id="cn-m7-282"><b>Source Identification</b>: The threat actor identifies sources from which information can be gathered.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-283"><b>Data Harvesting</b>: The threat actor collects information from identified sources.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-284"><b>Data Processing</b>: The threat actor processes and identifies information that can help in enumerating the target.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-285"><b>Data Analysis</b>: The threat actor performs data analysis of information that was processed in the previous phase.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-286"><b>Result Delivery</b>: This is the final phase in <b>OSINT </b>in which information about the target is finalized.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-287">Several sources can be targeted in OSINT. Some of the key ones are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-288">

<li id="cn-m7-288">Social media</li>

<li id="cn-m7-289">WHOIS repository</li>

<li id="cn-m7-290">Search engines</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m7-292"><b>Closed Source/Proprietary Intelligence</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-293">Closed-source intelligence is the opposite of 
open-source intelligence. The closed-source, also known as proprietary 
intelligence, is about gathering information from closed sources and is 
not generally available in the public domain. Some key personal sources 
can include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-294">

<li id="cn-m7-294">Business information</li>

<li id="cn-m7-295">Legal data</li>

<li id="cn-m7-296">Educational records</li>

<li id="cn-m7-297">Banking information</li>

<li id="cn-m7-298">Medical records</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-299">Most closed intelligence sources are meant to be 
confidential or secret and have limited access to selective individuals.
 This type of information is considered the most accurate and reliable 
as it is validated and stored with limited access.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-300">In most cases, regulations protect such information. 
For example, in the case of health information, the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States of 
America requires the protection of patients’ health records. Anyone 
dealing with health records must be regulated under HIPAA. These records
 need to be protected as defined within the regulation.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-301">The closed-source or proprietary source information's 
key intent is to ensure that its privacy, confidentiality, availability,
 and integrity must be protected. Therefore, gaining access to this type
 of information, even though it can be difficult, is a prime source of 
information that is already validated and accurate.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-302">Some of key company or business closed, or proprietary information is:</p>

<ol id="cn-m7-303">

<li id="cn-m7-303"><b>Marketing information </b>may include a competitive position or marketing strategy.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-304"><b>Manufacturing information </b>that may include future product information, formulas, or the methods to develop the product.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-305"><b>Financial information </b>may include the cost of manufacturing the product, targets, profits, balance statements, and order pipeline.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-306"><b>Research and development </b>may include the research information on a specific product that has not been created or is in its inception stage.</li>

</ol>

<p id="cn-m7-307">There are four key pillars of intelligence/information gathering, and these are known as CART, which stands for:</p>

<ol id="cn-m7-308">

<li id="cn-m7-308">Completeness</li>

<li id="cn-m7-309">Accuracy</li>

<li id="cn-m7-310">Relevance</li>

<li id="cn-m7-311">Timeliness</li>

</ol>

<p id="cn-m7-312">Let’s look at each one of them in detail.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m7-313"><b><i>Completeness</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-314">The intelligence process or information gathering must
 be complete in all senses. It should provide an appropriate level of 
detail and gather a level of information that must help conduct a full 
attack. As the Security Analyst, you must use this information to find 
loopholes and protect the infrastructures by filling said loopholes. To 
be able to respond to a threat, you need to have complete information 
and sufficient detail. Threat intelligence must provide sufficient 
detail to enable a proper response.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m7-315"><b><i>Accuracy</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-316">Intelligence that is gathered needs to be accurate. If
 it is inaccurate, it will lead you to make incorrect decisions that can
 severely impact the infrastructure and data integrity. Incomplete 
intelligence can also have severe financial and time consuming 
consequences. Therefore, reliable sources need to be used.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m7-317"><b><i>Relevancy</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-318">Intelligence that you gather must address a threat so 
that you can protect an asset or target. If you gather information about
 the threats that are not relevant to your organization, then such 
intelligence is of no use.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m7-319"><b><i>Timeliness</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-320">The intelligence that you gather must be prompt. If 
you are engaging with a target or trying to protect a target, you need 
to acquire the information before the attack occurs. Getting the target 
information after the attack has occurred will be of no use as the 
attack could have been prevented if the information was available 
beforehand.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-321"><b>Vulnerability Databases</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-322">Vulnerability databases are centralized repositories 
that collect, maintain, and update the vulnerability information. When a
 vulnerability in any application or device is discovered, it is then 
added to the vulnerability databases by its owners. Several 
vulnerability databases are available on the Internet. Most of these 
vulnerability databases allow you to subscribe to the feeds, providing 
an instant indication as to when a vulnerability is added.</p>

<span class="cn-quote" id="cn-m7-323"><b><i>Note: </i></b><i>Vulnerability feeds are discussed in the next exercise.</i></span>

<p id="cn-m7-324">For example, <b>mitre.org </b>has a list of vulnerabilities on Windows:</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-348"><b>Public and Private Information Sharing Centers</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-349">There are several public and private information sharing centers that can provide information related to security threats.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-350">Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (<b>ISACs</b>)
 established entities created for specific industries, and they are 
meant for sharing information. They help bridge the gap between the 
public and private sectors by sharing the most recent security-related 
information. They are meant to protect the critical infrastructure 
across different industries, such as Automotive, Health, Information 
Technology, Oil, Gas and Space.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-351">These organizations gather threat information about 
their domain and then share it with the other organizations in both the 
public and private sectors. There are various <b>ISACs </b>across different countries, which are:</p>

<ol id="cn-m7-352">

<li id="cn-m7-352"><b>Canada</b>: Global Mining and Metals Information Sharing &amp; Analysis Centre (<b>MM-ISAC</b>)</li>

<p id="cn-m7-355">Let’s look at some of the <b>ISACs </b>across different industries.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m7-356"><b><i>Healthcare</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-357">Healthcare Ready, which is the <b>ISAC </b>in the 
healthcare sector, focuses on strengthening supply chains. It also 
focuses on building collaboration between the public and the private 
sectors. One of its main agendas is to safeguard the patient's health 
data by providing best practices to healthcare organizations. Some of 
its key responsibilities are:</p>

<ol id="cn-m7-358">

<li id="cn-m7-358">Training and education</li>

<li id="cn-m7-359">Highlighting the importance of building resiliency into operations and activities that are performed in daily life.</li>

</ol>

<p id="cn-m7-360">It mainly targets the following:</p>

<ol id="cn-m7-361">

<li id="cn-m7-361">Healthcare officials</li>

<li id="cn-m7-362">Policymakers</li>

<li id="cn-m7-363">Organizations</li>

<li id="cn-m7-364">General public</li>

</ol>

<h4 id="cn-m7-365"><b><i>Financial</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-366"><b>FS-ISAC </b>focuses on the financial sector. It is a
 non-profit corporation that was established by the member organizations
 in the financial sector. The key role that <b>FS-ISAC </b>plays is to ensure the following:</p>

<ol id="cn-m7-367">

<li id="cn-m7-367">Help the organizations build resilience and&nbsp;continuity of their infrastructure.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-368">Share threat and vulnerability information with the organizations in the financial sector.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-369">Helps the organizations in training and building collaboration with the other organizations within the financial sector.</li>

</ol>

<h4 id="cn-m7-370"><b><i>Aviation</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-371">The Aviation <b>ISAC </b>is mainly focused on the 
aviation industry and helps organizations globally by sharing 
information related to cybersecurity. It shares the information with the
 organizations on the vulnerabilities, threats, and incidents as and 
when they occur from time to time. Some of its key tasks are to:</p>

<ol id="cn-m7-372">

<li id="cn-m7-372">Share the threat information as and when threats occur.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-373">Help in building strategies against threats that occur.</li>

<li id="cn-m7-374">Help in implementing the best practices in building a secure and resilient infrastructure.</li>

</ol>

<h3 id="cn-m7-375"><b>Dark Web</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-376">The Dark Web is a part of the Internet that is 
underground with several other names, such as DarkNet and Deep Web. What
 you see on the Internet is just a small portion, but the other larger 
part of the Internet runs in the Dark Web. Many users are using the Dark
 Web for illegal activities, hacking, and various other reasons 
prohibited by the law.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-377">The security professionals and law enforcement teams 
do use the Dark Web to gather threat-related information. There are 
forums and Websites, and even E-commerce Websites that sell you material
 that is prohibited by law. Forums, in particular, are a keen interest 
of the security professionals as they can gather various types of threat
 intel from the ongoing discussions.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-378"><b>Indicators of Compromise (IoC)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-379">When an attack occurs, it is difficult to trace the 
compromise indicators or the attacker's methods. OpenIoC provides a 
method to address this challenge by providing a standardized format. It 
helps in defining the standard format for describing artifacts that are 
discovered during the investigation. An example of capturing IoC is 
shown below:</p>

<p id="cn-m7-380"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-15" src="GatheringIntelligenceonThreatActorsandVectors_files/image-m7-c-15.jpg" alt="Figure 3.11 Diagram showing the IoC"><figcaption>Figure 3.11 Diagram showing the IoC: Showing the IoC sample for a backdoor created in the OpenIoC application.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m7-381">IoC can be of various types, and some of these are:</p>

<ol id="cn-m7-382">

<li id="cn-m7-382">Unusual network traffic that is either inbound or outbound</li>

<li id="cn-m7-383">Unusual activities performed by an administrative or privileged user account</li>

<li id="cn-m7-384">Unusual changes in the operating system or registry</li>

<li id="cn-m7-385">Unusual connections established from unknown sources</li>

<li id="cn-m7-386">Unusual DNS modifications and requests</li>

<li id="cn-m7-387">Untimely system patching</li>

</ol>

<h3 id="cn-m7-388"><b>Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-389">Automated Indicator Sharing or AIS is the invention of
 the Department of Homeland Security in the United States. The idea 
behind AIS is to provide threat indicators in real-time to the federal 
government and other organizations. With real-time information sharing, a
 threat actor can use a particular threat only once because the 
information has been shared with other organizations and federal 
departments.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-390"><b>Predictive Analysis</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-391">Predictive Analysis is a method in which you can 
predict the threats and risks in the future. It sources historical and 
other types of data to make predictions of the threats that can occur in
 the future. Some various methods and technologies are used in 
predictive analysis, which can include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-392">

<li id="cn-m7-392">Data mining</li>

<li id="cn-m7-393">Machine Learning</li>

<li id="cn-m7-394">Artificial Intelligence</li>

<li id="cn-m7-395">Statistics</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m7-396">These are not the only methods and technologies for 
predictive analysis. An organization may use other methods and 
technologies depending upon what they are looking for and the 
information sources.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-397"><b>File/Code Repositories</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-398">It is now common practice to use shared files and code
 repositories to share an application’s code between peers for ease of 
access. When a user writes code and wants to share it with others, a 
code repository, such as GitHub, is used. Developers often copy the 
private files or code files into their private repositories, which are 
then shared to a public repository to be reviewed by fellow developers. 
Anyone can search the public repositories and use the shared 
information.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-399">The information collated from public repositories can 
be used for attacks. For example, if the threat actor finds a 
vulnerability in application code, it can look for the same application 
deployed on the Internet. Then, the vulnerability within the application
 can be exploited. Various other types of information, such as hostnames
 and IP addresses, can be tracked from file and code repositories and 
can help the threat actor find more information about its 
infrastructure.</p>

<h2>CompTIA Security+ Practice Labs</h2>
<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m7-402"><b>Exercise 4 - Research Sources</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-403">Information about the threats can come from various 
sources. These sources are usually well researched to obtain information
 about the threats, bugs, and vulnerabilities.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-404">In this exercise, you will learn about research 
resources utilized by a security professional or a threat actor to gain 
more information about potential and new threats.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-406">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m7-407">

<li id="cn-m7-407">Vendor Websites</li>

<li id="cn-m7-408">Vulnerability Feeds</li>

<li id="cn-m7-409">Conferences</li>

<li id="cn-m7-410">Local Industry Groups</li>

<li id="cn-m7-411">Social Media</li>

<li id="cn-m7-412">Threat Feeds</li>

<li id="cn-m7-413">Adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP)</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Device</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m7-415">This exercise contains supporting materials for Security+.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-416"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-16" src="GatheringIntelligenceonThreatActorsandVectors_files/image-m7-c-16.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-417"><b>Vendor Websites</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-418">When a vulnerability is detected, the vendor who 
developed the application will disclose it on its website. The details 
of the vulnerability and patches or solutions that will help the user 
fix the vulnerability will also be available on the vendor’s website.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-419">Consider this example of Microsoft, which is 
mentioning the DNS Server vulnerability and the solution to remediate 
the vulnerability.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-420"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-17" src="GatheringIntelligenceonThreatActorsandVectors_files/image-m7-c-17.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 Diagram showing the Microsoft Website page"><figcaption>Figure 4.1 Diagram showing the Microsoft Website page: Showing vulnerability and its solution to close it.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m7-421">Threat actors would typically try to exploit such 
vulnerabilities because it is a somewhat known fact that a large number 
of administrators would not have fixed or patched the vulnerability.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-422"><b>Vulnerability Feeds</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-423">It is a difficult task for an individual or an 
organization to keep up with the discovered vulnerabilities. An 
individual or the organization would be most concerned with the 
vulnerabilities of applications or operating systems that they are 
using. However, it is difficult to keep abreast of the vulnerabilities 
of even a limited number of applications or operating systems.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-424">For example, let’s assume that a new vulnerability has
 been discovered in Windows Server, but you are unaware of it. You have 
several Windows Server systems that are exposed to the Internet. In such
 a scenario, these systems are likely to be compromised if the 
vulnerability is not patched. Therefore, the organizations or even the 
individuals should keep up with the vulnerabilities as and when they are
 discovered.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-425">Vulnerability feeds are a good method to get the 
latest information about the vulnerabilities. Vulnerability feeds are 
Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds that deliver the information once you 
subscribe to them. When you subscribe to the RSS feeds, you get an 
instant indication of a vulnerability when it is added to the database.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-426"><b>Conferences</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-427">Several organizations conduct conferences to update 
their partners and vendors about the threat intelligence. Some of these 
conferences are paid, and others can be free. Consider the following URL
 as an example:</p>

<p id="cn-m7-428">https://blog.cybersixgill.com/top-21-cybersecurity-threat-intelligence-events-in-2020</p>

<p id="cn-m7-429">This Website is mentioning the top threat intelligence
 conferences around the world. Organizations like SANS conferences 
feature on the top of the list. These conferences serve as a great 
resource for threat sources.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-430"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-18" src="GatheringIntelligenceonThreatActorsandVectors_files/image-m7-c-18.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-431"><b>Academic Journals</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-432">Cyber Security professionals will publish 
cyber-related academic journals that will contain information on 
cybersecurity best practices, cyber resiliency, cybercrime and warfare 
and various other cyber-related topics. Many journals may also contain 
case studies related to cybersecurity incidents that occurred. These 
journals can be published at a regular schedule, mostly quarterly.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-433"><b>Request for Comments (RFC)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-434">Cybersecurity research organizations that publish 
cybersecurity-related content, for example, academic journals, will 
request that other cybersecurity professionals check and validate the 
published material. This is to ensure the validity and integrity of the 
content.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-435"><b>Local Industry Groups</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-436">Local industry groups, such as a government or private
 body, provide the latest cybersecurity information, including threats, 
policies, threat adversaries, etc. They own the responsibility of 
researching and sharing information with the federal, public and private
 organizations. For example, in the United States, the National Security
 Agency (NSA) is responsible for providing threat information. They are 
also responsible for research in the cybersecurity domain, providing 
support to the military and threat intelligence.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-437"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-19" src="GatheringIntelligenceonThreatActorsandVectors_files/image-m7-c-19.jpg" alt="Figure 4.2 Diagram showing the NSA Website page"><figcaption>Figure 4.2 Diagram showing the NSA Website page: Showing the homepage of NSA Website.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-438"><b>Social Media</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-439">Social media is a good research source. You can follow
 several industry leaders and their organizations to get the latest 
threat intelligence and its related information. For example, Twitter is
 a good source of such information, as shown in the exhibit below:</p>

<p id="cn-m7-440"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-20" src="GatheringIntelligenceonThreatActorsandVectors_files/image-m7-c-20.jpg" alt="Figure 4.3 Diagram showing the Twitter page"><figcaption>Figure 4.3 Diagram showing the Twitter page: Showing a threat information tweet.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m7-441">In this exhibit, you are getting information from 
reliable sources. There are numerous users and organizations that you 
can follow to get first-hand information. Twitter is not the only social
 media platform. There are other social media platforms, like Facebook, 
that can provide similar information. However, Twitter is widely used 
for sharing quick and short information.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-442"><b>Threat Feeds</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-443">Threat feeds provide information on the threats and 
threat actors. This type of information can be handy and useful for the 
Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), who can update their 
data about threats and threat actors. Threat feeds also direct the CSIRT
 teams to update their incident management plans.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-444">There are various types of threat feeds available on the Internet. For example, an organization named <b>threatfeeds.io </b>provides threat feeds, which can also be downloaded. Different organizations contribute to their list. For example, <b>AlienVault </b>has added an IP Reputation feed, as shown in the exhibit.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-445"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m7-c-21" src="GatheringIntelligenceonThreatActorsandVectors_files/image-m7-c-21.jpg" alt="Figure 4.4 Diagram showing the threat feeds page"><figcaption>Figure 4.4 Diagram showing the threat feeds page: Showing various threat feeds on threatfeeds.io Website.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-447"><b>Adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-448">There is a good old saying, “A known devil is better 
than an unknown devil.” Each threat actor has a unique style of 
operation and uses specific techniques and methods. You should know 
these methods, styles, and techniques. Even if the threat actors conduct
 their attacks, their methods and techniques fundamentally remain the 
same.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-449">For example, Anonymous, a hacktivist group, uses a 
traditional DDoS attack using Low Orbit Ion Cannon&nbsp;(LOIC). If your 
organization is doing something that Anonymous does not like or support,
 they warn you and then conduct a DDoS attack. The majority of their 
attacks have been successful against the corporations, such as PayPal, 
Visa, and Mastercard.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-450">It is good to know the TTP of a threat actor. If you 
also have the indicators, it adds value because you know for sure that 
there is an attack coming your way.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-454">Threat maps depict the occurrence of threats in 
real-time. Several cybersecurity organizations have live threat maps 
that are displaying the threat data in real-time. For example, 
Checkpoint.com has a threat map that displays a great deal of 
information, such as:</p>

<ol id="cn-m7-455">

<li id="cn-m7-455">Top targeted countries</li>

<li id="cn-m7-456">Top targeted industries</li>

<li id="cn-m7-457">Top malware types</li>

<p id="cn-m7-459">The <b>https://threatmap.fortiguard.com </b>displays 
the attacks in a slightly different manner. It shows the source 
countries shooting either missiles or asteroids at the target country. A
 table at the bottom shows the attack, severity, and location.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-539">It is true that all software - application software 
and infrastructure or system software (and sometimes hardware) - has 
vulnerabilities. Some vulnerabilities have not been discovered yet, and 
others are fairly well-known. There are many sources of threat 
intelligence available across the Internet.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-540">Many vulnerabilities are published in an online, 
searchable database, called the National Vulnerability Database. It is 
easily accessible and is maintained by the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST), which is part of the United States 
Department of Commerce. This database is much more than a list; it 
includes a complex scoring and evaluation system, and details on 
thousands of known vulnerabilities.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-541">NIST defines vulnerability as "a weakness in the 
computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware 
components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact on 
confidentiality, integrity, or&nbsp;availability.”  The information 
provided for each vulnerability in the NIST database is very specific to
 the Software or hardware component and version, and often fairly 
technical in its explanation.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-542">The acronym CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
 is also used to describe vulnerabilities in this database.  As 
additional research sources, more information, including workarounds and
 permanent solutions for specific vulnerabilities, may be found on 
software vendors’ websites.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m7-554"><b>Task 1 - Use the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m7-555">When you find several vulnerabilities within your 
infrastructure, you would probably not know how to rank them or assign 
scores to them. CVSS helps you assign a score to each of the 
vulnerabilities. For example, you may have a vulnerability that risks 
your data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Using CVSS, 
you can determine the score.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-556">The scores are calculated based on several metrics. 
Once you define these metrics, you would be able to determine the CVSS 
score of a vulnerability. For example, a score of 10 to a vulnerability 
would make it severe. You can also use CVSS calculators that can help 
you calculate the scores.</p>

<p id="cn-m7-557">To be able to determine the CVSS score, perform the following steps:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m7-558"><b><i>Step 1</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m7-559">Ensure that the required devices are powered on and connect to <b>PLABWIN10</b>.</p>

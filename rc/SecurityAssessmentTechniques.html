<p id="cn-m9-86">Cyber threats continue to evolve, displaying new 
varieties and harder challenges. Together, these factors make it more 
difficult to tackle the threats, and organizations are continuously 
looking out for more and more sophisticated solutions. Most of the time,
 a combination of different methods is required to tackle the onslaught 
of the mix of existing and evolving threats.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-87">In this exercise, you will learn about the threat hunting methods.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m9-89">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m9-90">

<li id="cn-m9-90">Intelligence Fusion</li>

<li id="cn-m9-91">Threat Feeds</li>

<li id="cn-m9-92">Advisories and Bulletins</li>

<li id="cn-m9-93">Maneuver</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m9-95">This exercise contains supporting materials for Security+.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-96"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m9-c-1" src="SecurityAssessmentTechniques_files/image-m9-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-97"><b>Intelligence Fusion</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-98">You need to know about a threat to tackle it. Threat 
intelligence provides insights about the threats and can help the 
organization proactively improve security. To provide effective security
 measures, organizations must have valid and relevant sources for 
intelligence. However, no single threat intelligence source can provide 
information about all threats. Some can provide information about 
network threats, while others may be specific to physical threats.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-99">Therefore, it is advised to gather information from a 
combination of threat intelligence sources. The merging of threat 
intelligence information is known as threat fusion. Intelligence fusion 
broadens the scope of intelligence gathered about known and emerging 
threats.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-100"><b>Threat Feeds</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-101">A threat feed is a real-time feed of information about
 threats. Threat feeds make you aware of the threats present on the 
Internet. Based on the gained information, you can analyze whether your 
organization has faced any similar threats or is likely to face any of 
these threats going forward. Accordingly, you can prepare the 
countermeasures for various threats and ramp-up the security controls.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-102">Along with the real-time information about threats, a threat feed can also list:</p>

<ul id="cn-m9-103">

<li id="cn-m9-103">Indicators of compromise (IoC)</li>

<li id="cn-m9-104">Suspicious domains and IP addresses</li>

<li id="cn-m9-105">Malware and their hashes</li>

<li id="cn-m9-106">Compromised IP addresses</li>

<li id="cn-m9-107">Dictionary SSH attacks</li>

<li id="cn-m9-108">Domains blacklist</li>

<li id="cn-m9-109">Botnet IP addresses</li>

<li id="cn-m9-110">Malware URLs</li>

<li id="cn-m9-111">Bad IP addresses</li>

<li id="cn-m9-112">Malware domains list</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m9-115"><b>Advisories and Bulletins</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-116">A security advisory is a document that details a 
vulnerability found in a product. When a product development 
organization finds a vulnerability in its product, it usually releases 
an advisory that states the vulnerability and methods to minimize the 
risk or prevent exposure from the vulnerability.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-117">For example, consider the following security advisory 
about a product that contains the Cross-site scripting (XSS) 
vulnerability.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-118"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m9-c-3" src="SecurityAssessmentTechniques_files/image-m9-c-3.jpg" alt="Figure 1.2 Screenshot of a Windows desktop: Vulnerability details in a Security Advisory are listed."><figcaption>Figure 1.2 Screenshot of a Windows desktop: Vulnerability details in a Security Advisory are listed.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m9-120">In this advisory, the product development organization lists the vulnerability and mitigation methods.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-122"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m9-c-4" src="SecurityAssessmentTechniques_files/image-m9-c-4.jpg" alt="Figure 1.3 Screenshot of a Windows desktop: Remediation details in a Security Advisory are listed."><figcaption>Figure 1.3 Screenshot of a Windows desktop: Remediation details in a Security Advisory are listed.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m9-124">While advisories are released as and when 
vulnerabilities are found, the security bulletins are released monthly. 
The product development organization mentions the vulnerabilities in its
 products, the remediation methods, and the relevant updates if any.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-125">Here is an example of a monthly security bulletin from Microsoft.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-128"><b>Maneuver </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-129">In the old days, maneuver referred to a warfighting 
method in which military forces were positioned at a strategic advantage
 to the enemy forces. This exercise was supposed to help win a war while
 minimizing the loss of life and resources. Similarly, in terms of 
cyberspace, maneuver refers to manipulating various technological 
resources - applications, codes, and methods - to either attack a target
 or defend your network against an attack. For example, if under threat,
 your network administrator might install an additional firewall on the 
network. This will help deter the attacker and even minimize damage to 
the technological resources on your network.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-130">Although the concept of maneuver is similar in 
military application and cyberspace application, the similarity ends 
there. The characteristics of the two maneuvers are totally different, 
mainly because of the differences in the arena of operation. 
Characteristics of cyber maneuvering include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m9-131">

<li id="cn-m9-131">Speed: Speed is one of the key characteristics of 
either type of maneuvering. However, in cyberspace, the attacks occur at
 lightning speed and rarely provide the target a chance to defend 
itself. By the time the targets react, the damage is already done.</li>

<li id="cn-m9-132">Reach: In a military maneuver, it might be difficult 
to move a large force from one location to another. However, in 
cyberspace's virtual realm, it is possible to reach from one end to the 
other end of the world without much effort.</li>

<li id="cn-m9-133">Access: A cyber maneuver can help you get into the 
target network and access information and data, which can cripple the 
target network and target business to a great extent.</li>

<li id="cn-m9-134">Anonymity: A cyber maneuver can help you cause severe
 damage to the target and yet remain anonymous. In most cases, it might 
even be difficult to trace back the attack.</li>

<h2>CompTIA Security+ Practice Labs</h2>
<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m9-137"><b>Exercise 2 - Studying Vulnerability Scans</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m9-138">It is common for every operating system or application
 to have vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities must be identified and 
closed. Vulnerability scans list out the vulnerabilities identified. To 
keep a watch on the health of the network, every organization runs 
vulnerability scans regularly. Depending on various factors, the 
interval between the scans can differ for each organization. For 
example, an organization with thousands of servers may decide to run the
 vulnerability scan every six months. However, a smaller organization 
may run it every quarter.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-139">In this exercise, you will learn about vulnerability scans.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m9-160"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m9-c-6" src="SecurityAssessmentTechniques_files/image-m9-c-6.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-161"><b>Configuration Review</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-162">All hardware devices and software have out-of-the-box 
default configuration settings. When installing a hardware device or 
software, these default settings are implemented, which might not be 
secure. These settings need to be modified as per the network 
requirements to make the system secure. For example, consider a wireless
 access point (WAP) connected to the network with the default 
configuration and user credentials. Anyone with basic knowledge of 
networking would be able to break through the WAP, gain unauthorized 
access to the network, and damage the whole system.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-163">To avoid such issues, you need to perform a 
configuration review of the software and hardware devices. Configuration
 reviews help detect security misconfigurations and other issues, such 
as out-of-the-box configuration.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-164">Moreover, configuration reviews can be used to 
benchmark the devices and software against any organizational 
configuration baseline. For example, if you have a configuration 
baseline for desktop systems running Windows 10, then all desktops with 
Windows 10 can be verified against this baseline. This review will 
highlight any configuration deviations that might make the system 
unsecured, thereby posing a security threat. Hence, it is advisable to 
run configuration reviews regularly.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-165"><b>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-166">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are 
vulnerabilities in published operating systems and applications 
software. These are publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-167">When you find several vulnerabilities within your 
infrastructure, you would probably not know how to rank them or assign 
scores to them. Assigning scores to vulnerabilities helps to prioritize 
them based on their severity level. Hence, vulnerabilities with high 
scores will be remediated first. Common Vulnerability Scoring System 
(CVSS) helps assign a score to each vulnerability. For example, you may 
have a vulnerability that is a risk to your data's confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability. Using CVSS, you can determine the score. 
With multiple vulnerabilities, you can determine the vulnerability has a
 high score and must be handled on a priority basis.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-168">The scores are calculated based on several metrics. 
Once you define these metrics, you would be able to determine the CVSS 
score for a vulnerability. For example, a score of 10 would make a 
vulnerability severe. You can also use CVSS calculators that can help 
you calculate the scores.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-169"><b>Application, Web Application, and Network</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-170">Vulnerabilities are bound to exist in applications, 
Web applications, and the network. You use an appropriate vulnerability 
scanner to identify these vulnerabilities and close them. The 
vulnerability scanners list the vulnerabilities as well as suggestions 
and remediations to close them. For example, Nikto for Web server 
scanner identifies the vulnerabilities and provides suggestions to close
 these vulnerabilities.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-171">Just before you run a vulnerability scan, you need to 
scope the run. For example, you specify whether to run the scan on a 
single application or the entire network.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-172"><b>False Positive</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-173">A vulnerability scan result might list false 
positives. False positive refers to a vulnerability that might be listed
 as one though it does not exist. For example, a scan result may list a 
vulnerability in MySQL, while in reality, the listed vulnerability does 
not exist or is not considered a vulnerability.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-174">A vulnerability scanner may show false positives 
because it is unable to recognize an executable or a service. The 
reasons for this can be:</p>

<ul id="cn-m9-175">

<li id="cn-m9-175">To cover up a vulnerability, you may have implemented
 a compensating control. Therefore, listing of the vulnerability in a 
scan result is a false positive because a compensating control is 
already covering the vulnerability.</li>

<li id="cn-m9-176">The vulnerability scanner does not have updated definitions.</li>

<li id="cn-m9-177">The scanner configurations are outdated or 
irrelevant. This might result in services or configuration settings 
marked as false positives.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m9-178">As a pentester, you must be able to identify false 
positives. Each scan result must be researched and analyzed to ascertain
 if it is a false positive. This can help avoid wasteful effort in 
fixing these vulnerabilities.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-179"><b>False Negative</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-180">A false negative is the opposite of a false positive. A
 false negative is a vulnerability that exists within the system or 
applications but is missed by the scanner. For example, you run a 
vulnerability scanner, and it lists only a few vulnerabilities within 
the system. Then, you test the operating system and applications with a 
second vulnerability scanner and find several new vulnerabilities, which
 were missed by the first vulnerability scanner. The missed 
vulnerabilities are referred to as false negatives.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-181"><b>Credentialed vs. Non-Credentialed Scans</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-182">After you have defined the vulnerability scanning 
scope, you also need to decide whether you will be performing a 
credentialed or a non-credentialed scan. Depending on your requirement, 
you can choose either one.</p>

<ul id="cn-m9-183">

<li id="cn-m9-183"><b>Credentialed Scan</b>: To run a credentialed scan,
 you need to have administrative access to the system and run the scan 
from the administrative account credentials. This scan probes deeper 
into the system and provides a more comprehensive vulnerability list. A 
credentialed scan is more thorough and takes longer to perform.</li>

<li id="cn-m9-184"><b>Non-Credentialed Scan</b>: This vulnerability scan
 requires no specific credentials. The non-credentialed scan is a 
limited scan as it cannot scan deep into the applications or systems 
that require credentialed access. It is mainly focused on finding the 
open ports and the services or software using these ports. This scan is 
quicker with a limited vulnerability list.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m9-185"><b>Intrusive vs. Non-intrusive</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-186">A vulnerability scan can either be intrusive or 
non-intrusive. In a non-intrusive vulnerability scan, the scanner only 
looks for the vulnerabilities. For example, it can scan for missing 
updates or look for open ports. It does not go beyond the scanning 
process. The intrusive scan goes one step beyond the non-intrusive scan.
 It not only scans for the vulnerabilities, but it also attempts to 
exploit them. It is always advisable not to use intrusive scans on 
production systems and live applications.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-187"><b>Task 1 - Perform Log Reviews</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-188">Each application and the operating system generates

<h2>CompTIA Security+ Practice Labs</h2>
<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m9-471"><b>Exercise 3 - Exploring Syslog/Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m9-472">Each application and operating system generates 
various types of events. These events are captured in logs maintained by
 a tool or service within the operating system. The logs can be useful 
during a forensic investigation.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-473">Implementing Syslog/Security Information and Event 
Management (SIEM) provides a continuous view of the events, thereby 
helping monitor system-health.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-474">A SIEM is the best choice if you want to filter out 
unnecessary event information and collate only the required 
security-specific events.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-475">In this exercise, you will learn about various features of SIEM.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m9-477">After completing this exercise, you should be able to:</p>

<ul id="cn-m9-478">

<li id="cn-m9-478">Implement SIEM</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m9-479">After completing this module, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m9-480">

<li id="cn-m9-480">Review Reports</li>

<li id="cn-m9-481">Packet Capture</li>

<ol id="cn-m9-496">

</ol>

<h3 id="cn-m9-497"><b>Review Reports</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-498">Each SIEM product generates different review reports -
 differing in format and parameters monitored. However, in general, 
review reports give a detailed insight into the network traffic 
behavior. For example, you can configure the SIEM to detect the system 
name, the time, and the number of remote connections.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-499">To make SIEM implementation effective, it is critical 
to review the SIEM reports regularly. Reports generated will not hold 
any value if they are not reviewed. For example, a system named PLABDM01
 has an event logging shutdown. This should be alarming. However, 
without reviewing the report, you would have no intimation about this 
event.</p>

Logging Service Shutdown data is displayed on the EventLog Analyzer 
screen.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-502"><b>Packet Capture</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-503">Packet capture (pcap) is the process of intercepting 
one or more data packets that move through a network. The packets can 
either be analyzed when they are captured or can be stored for later 
analysis. You may have an Intrusion Detection System / Intrusion 
Prevention System (IDS/IPS) deployed on the network that can analyze 
these packets and detect possible cyberattacks. You can integrate them 
with the SIEM so that the captured packets can be analyzed for security 
threats.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-504">Some SIEM may display the capability to analyze the network traffic for security threats.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-505"><b>Data Inputs</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-506">Data inputs in a SIEM can come from a variety of 
devices and systems. Some SIEM also provides the capability to import 
existing logs for analysis.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-507"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m9-c-49" src="SecurityAssessmentTechniques_files/image-m9-c-49.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 Screenshot of PLABDM01 desktop: Status of the files imported is listed on the Import Log Files tab on the EventLog Analyzer screen."><figcaption>Figure

listed on the Import Log Files tab on the EventLog Analyzer screen.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m9-509">Logs can be imported from any device that you have added in SIEM.</p>

 Import Configuration tab of EventLog Analyzer screen.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-512"><b>User Behavior Analysis (UBA)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-513">Insider threats are a big pain for organizations. In 
today’s world, organizations are equally prone to danger from outside 
and inside the network. UBA, unlike the other security controls, is 
focused on insider threats. It monitors the users’ behavior on the 
network, and then based on the analysis of the monitored behavior, it 
can detect the anomalies.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-514">UBA focuses on unusual behavior that might originate 
from users, processes, or even malware. Unlike SIEM, UBA mainly focuses 
on the applications, firewalls, and other devices' logs. The intent is 
to detect unusual behavior and raise a flag to help minimize the damage.
 It is important to note that UBA can only detect but cannot prevent an 
attacker from getting into your network.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-516"><b>Sentiment Analysis</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-517">In many cases, cyberattacks are driven by opinions and
 for financial reasons. In other cases, the attacks can be reactions to 
some social events. Anonymous hackers are one such group that fights for
 social causes. In a way, you can say that social sentiments drive 
cyberattacks.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-518">Twitter and other social networking sites are a good 
dump yard for the users’ sentiments. Several attacks have taken place 
based on the sentiments that’s poured on social networking sites. A deep
 analysis of views and sentiments shared on these sites can give 
insights into the attacks. Performing sentiment analysis of social media
 posts can help determine the mood of a person.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-519"><b>Security Monitoring</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-520">On a network, it is critical to monitor security 
continuously. The administrators must review the event logs and draw 
analysis out of them. SIEM can complement security monitoring in a great
 way. Not only can it monitor the security of the systems, but it can 
also review logs and generate alerts as and when required.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-521">Hackers can delete the logs before exiting a device or
 a system. This is a standard practice to ensure removing their traces. 
However, SIEM uses the Write Once Read Many (WORM) functionality, in 
which the data cannot be modified once it is written.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-522"><b>Log Aggregation</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-523">Log aggregation is one of the features of SIEM. It can
 collate logs from different devices on the network, including servers, 
appliances, and firewalls. The log aggregation implements deduplication 
technology that does not collate duplicate data.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-524">After installing SIEM, you configure aggregation - 
collecting events from multiple sources. After that, you configure 
correlation. The correlation engine performs deduplication - removing 
duplicate events from various sources.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-525">It is especially important to understand that in SIEM,
 time synchronization across sources is extremely critical. It must be 
configured before putting the SIEM appliance on the network.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-526"><b>Log Collectors</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-527">The main job of SIEM is to collect logs and store them
 in a central location and further analyze them for security issues. The
 log collection is done using several methods, such as installing an 
agent on the target device. These agents are known as log collectors.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-528">The log collectors' main job is to continue to run on 
the target device, read through the event logs, parse them, and send 
them to the SIEM server, where an aggregator stores them. The SIEM 
server analyzes the logs to draw conclusions.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-529"><b>Security Orchestration, Automation, Response (SOAR)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-530">SOAR is a combination of tools and technologies that 
help an organization strengthen its security. As and when there is an 
incident, the automated processes are designed to handle the incident. 
It can be configured to perform various tasks, such as data collection, 
standardization, and analytics, as well as handle security alerts and 
alarms in an automated manner. Therefore, implementing SOAR helps save 
the organization several hundred man-hours and remove the limitations of
 manual intervention. For example, SIEM may generate too many alerts 
that the security team can handle. SOAR can be integrated to handle this
 load.</p>

<p id="cn-m9-531">SOAR can help the organization build an in-depth 
defense posture. For example, with SOAR, you can collect the alerts and 
alarm data in a central location for further analysis. You can also 
create custom and complex workflows to strengthen the security posture.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m9-532"><b>Task 1 - Implement SIEM</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m9-533">There are various SIEM products available in the 
market. Some of them are commercial, free, or open-source. Each product 
has its capabilities and features that mostly overlap with other 
products. ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer is one of the SIEM products

<h2>CompTIA Security+ Practice Labs</h2>
<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m24-57"><b>Exercise 1 - Incident Response Process, Attack Frameworks and Stakeholder Management</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m24-58">An incident is any occurrence that has a negative 
outcome on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an 
organization’s assets. Organizations commonly outline the meaning of a 
computer security incident within their security policy or incident 
response plans.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-59">The definition is usually one or two sentences long 
and contains examples of common incidents that the organization 
classifies as security incidents, such as the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m24-60">

<li id="cn-m24-60">Any attempted network intrusion</li>

<li id="cn-m24-61">Any attempted denial-of-service attack</li>

<li id="cn-m24-62">Any detection of malicious software</li>

<li id="cn-m24-63">Any unauthorized access to data</li>

<li id="cn-m24-64">Any violation of security policies</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m24-65">In this exercise, you will learn about incident response processes, attack frameworks and stakeholder communications.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-74"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m24-c-1" src="IncidentResponsePoliciesandProcedures_files/image-m24-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m24-76"><b>Incident Response Steps</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m24-77">Effective incident response management is handled in 
several steps or phases, this is referred to as the incident response 
plan. It is important to realize that incident response is an ongoing 
activity; once the incident is resolved, there is usually a meeting held
 and a lesson learned report created based on the findings. The lessons 
learned report results are used to improve detection methods or help 
prevent a repeated incident.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-78">The following are the common phases of incident response if a security event has been detected:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-79"><b><i>Preparation</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-80">After a security incident has been detected, a team 
should be assembled to handle and assess the situation. Incident 
handling should always relate to company security policies and awareness
 programs. The Incident reporting process should be centralized, easy to
 accomplish, and easy to use and understood.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-81"><b><i>Identification</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-82">After a Cyber Security incident has been detected, the
 type of incident needs to be identified to create a plan of action on 
how to handle the specific incident. Various types of Cybersecurity 
incidents can occur, for example, a phishing attack.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-83"><b><i>Containment</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-84">The goal of containment is to thwart or reduce any 
further damage from the incident. Proper remediation strategy buys time 
for proper investigation and identification of the root cause of the 
incident. The remediation strategy should be based on the category of 
the attack, the assets impacted by the incident and its criticality. 
These strategies can be proactive or reactive.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-85"><b><i>Eradication</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-86">The eradication phase of the incident response steps 
involves the removal of the specific threat. If the threat had managed 
to move across multiple systems, these systems need to be evaluated and 
the threat removed.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-87"><b><i>Recovery</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-88">After the threat has been successfully removed, the 
next step will be to recover any data and services. Depending on the 
severity of the threat, this may include restoring data from backups or 
other data loss prevention mechanisms that were implemented. It is 
essential to collect any evidence of the incident before the recovery 
process is started to ensure preventative measures can be implemented in
 the future.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-89"><b><i>Lessons Learned</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-90">Based on the investigation and remediation after the 
incident, a permanent solution must be implemented to thwart a similar 
incident's reoccurrence. Identification of Indicators of Attack (IoA) 
can be used to identify similar incidents in the future. Also, 
collecting the Indicators of Compromise (IoC) will tell if the attack 
has been successful and security is compromised. A review of the 
incident and a post mortem analysis needs to be done to develop a 
response strategy.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m24-91"><b>Incident Management Exercises</b></h3>

<h4 id="cn-m24-92"><b><i>Tabletop</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-93">A Cybersecurity tabletop exercise is used by companies
 to assess how a cybersecurity incident will be handled. It includes the
 assessment of the current strategies and procedures when an incident 
occurs. Another purpose of this type of exercise is to assess the 
company's current security posture and update the necessary policies and
 procedures to facilitate a proper response in the event of a 
cybersecurity incident.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-94"><b><i>Walkthroughs</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-95">Conduct a walkthrough of each scenario on your own or 
with your team before performing an official Tabletop Test. This allows 
you to work through different scenarios and identify how they mimic 
real-world instances. For instance, if your organization needs to be 
careful of email phishing, a part of your phishing policy should discuss
 the possibility of the distribution of malware by the phishing email 
spreading to other systems in the organization.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-96">Taking that extra step with your Incident Response 
scenarios can be helpful because it puts in standpoints for what your 
organization needs to reflect in addition to just phishing email 
awareness. It also allows you to discuss what steps to respond and 
recover from these scenarios may need to be developed.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-97"><b><i>Simulations</i></b></h4>

<ul id="cn-m24-98">

<li id="cn-m24-98">The exercise plan includes real scenarios and injects into the exercise.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-99">This type of exercise calls for detailed coordination and planning.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-100">Requires a large number of organizational participants, IT resources, travel budget for meetings and deconfliction contacts.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m24-101">Lessons learned from simulations include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m24-102">

<li id="cn-m24-102">Aims on what went well and what required improvement.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-103">Evaluate capability for detecting, responding to, and recovering from some simulated events.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-104">Evaluate and update the baseline.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-105">Create a mitigation plan for issues.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m24-106"><b>Attack Frameworks</b></h3>

<h4 id="cn-m24-107"><b><i>MITRE ATT&amp;CK</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-108">MITRE developed ATT&amp;CK as a model to document and
 track numerous techniques attackers use during the different stages of a
 cyber attack to penetrate a network and exfiltrate data. ATT&amp;CK 
stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="cn-m24-109">ATT&amp;CK describes the following tactics used in a cyberattack:</p>

<ul id="cn-m24-110">

<li id="cn-m24-110">Initial Access - techniques that use different entry vectors to obtain an initial foothold within a network.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-111">Execution- techniques that result in running malicious code on a local or remote system.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-112">Persistence - techniques used to preserve persistent access to a system.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-113">Privilege Escalation - techniques used to obtain higher-level privileges on a system or network.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-114">Defense Evasion - techniques used to prevent detection.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-115">Credential Access - methodologies for stealing credentials such as account names and passwords.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-116">Discovery - techniques used to obtain knowledge about the system and internal network.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-117">Lateral Movement - techniques used to control remote systems on a network from the previously compromised host.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-118">Collection  -  techniques used to collate information relevant to following through on the attacker’s objectives.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-119">Exfiltration - methodologies used to steal data from your network.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-120">Command and Control - techniques attackers may use 
to communicate with systems under their control, often impersonated to 
look like normal HTTP traffic.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m24-121"><b><i>Cyber Kill Chain</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-122">The&nbsp;Cyber Kill Chain&nbsp;relates to the old 
military kill chain model to a cyberattack. It’s intended for defenders 
to improve their defenses by examining an attacker’s playbook and 
disrupting the attack by breaking the kill chain at each phase.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-123">The seven phases of the cyber kill chain are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m24-125">

<li id="cn-m24-125">Reconnaissance&nbsp;</li>

<li id="cn-m24-126">Weaponization&nbsp;</li>

<li id="cn-m24-127">Delivery&nbsp;</li>

<li id="cn-m24-128">Exploitation&nbsp;</li>

<li id="cn-m24-129">Installation&nbsp;</li>

<li id="cn-m24-130">Command &amp; Control</li>

<li id="cn-m24-131">Actions on objectives</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m24-133"><b>Reconnaissance: </b>Attackers collects information
 about their target. This contains indirect and passive methods where 
attackers collect information from public resources. Attackers will then
 move to a more direct and active approach, such as port scanning.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-134"><b>Weaponization:&nbsp;</b>Attackers now generate an 
attack that exploits vulnerabilities found from the reconnaissance 
phase. Exploitation tools such as metasploit, exploit-db, or a social 
engineering toolkit can be used to generate the attack.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-135"><b>Delivery:&nbsp;</b>Once an attacker has selected 
which tools are well-matched to exploit the discovered vulnerabilities, 
they will handpick the delivery method, which will be best suited for 
the found exploit.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-136"><b>Exploitation:&nbsp;</b>After the exploitation 
method has been prepared and distributed to the vulnerable device, the 
attack needs to be initiated, for example, a SQL injection attack or a 
Buffer overflow.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-137"><b>Installation:&nbsp;</b>When the attack on the 
vulnerability has succeeded, the next phase of the compromise will be 
installing malevolent tools to maintain access. Common adversarial 
practices include executing a powershell script in a file-less attack, 
installing remote access tools (RAT), and DLL hijacking.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-138"><b>Command &amp; Control:&nbsp;</b>The sixth phase of
 the Cyber Kill Chain is the compromised system's persistent control, 
which will give the attacker access to the exploited resources. In 
addition to the control, lateral movement across the network can also be
 achieved by compromising further devices and accessing additional 
resources and data.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-139"><b>Actions on Objectives:&nbsp;</b>The final phase is
 achieving the goal of the attack; this can include compromising data, a
 Denial of Service (DoS) attack or corrupting business-critical data.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-140"><b><i>Diamond Model for Intrusion Analysis</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-141">The Diamond Model for Intrusion Analysis is the 
process of analyzing any intrusion event that occurs on a network or 
system. The event includes four core features; adversary, 
infrastructure, capability, and victim. It further defines two important
 meta-features; technology connecting the infrastructure and capability 
enabling operations. The social-political meta-feature describes the 
always-existing and sometimes enduring relationship between adversary 
and victim.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m24-142"><b>Stakeholder Management and Communication</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m24-143">Organizations should form a communication role in 
their incident response team to communicate the incident's impact to 
external stakeholders. This person does not need to be highly technical 
but should have enough technical knowledge to be able to understand the 
impact of the incident and be able to explain it in a non-technical 
manner.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-144"><b><i>Responding to Stakeholders</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-145">In the event of a cyber incident, basic crisis communications guiding principles should be followed:</p>

<ul id="cn-m24-146">

<li id="cn-m24-146">Admit there is a problem and regulate the message to relevant parties.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-147">Prudently assemble the facts and deliver them in a straightforward, conversational manner.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-148">Elect one trusted professional as the spokesperson and have that individual update the relevant parties regularly.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-149">Use distinguished, jargon-free language.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-150">Explain how the reoccurrence of the incident will be prevented in the future.</li>

<p id="cn-m24-153">Disaster recovery planning brings order to the chaos 
that surrounds the disruption of an organization’s normal activities. A 
disaster recovery plan should be set up so that it can practically run 
on autopilot. The DRP should also be intended to decrease 
decision-making activities during a disaster as much as possible.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m24-166"><b>Recovery Sites</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m24-167">Based on business requirements, it might be necessary
 to have a location where an organization can relocate following a 
disaster recovery, also known as a recovery or backup site.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-168"><b><i>Hot Site</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-169">A hot backup site is a duplicate of the 
organization’s current data center. All systems are configured with 
near-complete backups of user data. Typically, real-time synchronization
 is used between sites to ensure the data is current. While a hot site 
is the most expensive option, it enables the organization to restore 
normal operations in the shortest time with minimal losses after a 
disaster.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-170"><b><i>Warm Site</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-171">A warm site contains all the required hardware and 
connectivity to restore services, it is a reasonable duplicate of the 
organization’s current data center. However, data must be restored after
 a disaster; for example, the last backups from the off-site storage 
facility must be delivered and bare metal restoration must be completed.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m24-172"><b>Backup Concepts</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m24-173">When planning for a data restore after a disaster, an
 organization should choose the appropriate backup type that meets its 
business requirements.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-174"><b><i>Full</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-175">A full backup is a complete copy of the data. A full 
backup provides the simplest recovery method since the entire data can 
be easily restored using a single recovery set.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-176"><b><i>Incremental</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-177">An incremental backup duplicates only the data that 
has changed since the previous backup, irrespective of whether the 
backup was full or incremental. An incremental backup provides the 
fastest backup time and requires the smallest amount of backup storage. 
However, an incremental backup has a slower recovery time since all 
incremental backups must be restored.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-178"><b><i>Differential</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-179">A differential backup copies only the data that has 
changed since the previous full backup. It is considered a cumulative 
incremental backup. A differential backup provides a faster restore time
 and requires less backup storage than an incremental backup. However, a
 differential backup requires more time to create than an incremental 
backup.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-180"><b><i>Snapshots</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-181">A snapshot is a copy of an application, disk or 
system. Typically, an organization will use a snapshot to restore a 
system or disk to a specific time. However, a snapshot is not commonly 
used as a periodic backup strategy because of the amount of backup time 
and backup storage required.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m24-182"><b>Geographic Considerations</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m24-183">An organization must include geographic diversity 
when planning for business continuity and disaster recovery. This can be
 achieved by ensuring the recovery site for the business is 
geographically dispersed. If a natural disaster occurs where the 
business is situated, it will ensure that the data will be safe for 
recovery.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-184"><b><i>Off-site Backups</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-185">While implementing backups ensures redundancy of 
data, hosting the backups in an off-site location ensures the redundant 
data does not have a single geographic point of failure.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-186"><b><i>Distance</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-187">An organization should include enough distance 
between a primary and secondary site to minimize the potential for a 
disaster that affects both sites simultaneously.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-188"><b><i>Location Selection</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-189">When choosing the location of a primary or secondary 
site, it is important to assess the environmental risks, such as whether
 the location is susceptible to specific natural disasters.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-190"><b><i>Legal Implications</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-191">Based on an organization’s industry, there might be 
laws that impact business continuity planning. For example, businesses 
in the healthcare industry are required to have a disaster recovery plan
 with established guidelines for electronic records and signatures. 
There is a diverse range of laws that govern the healthcare, government,
 finance and utility industries.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-192"><b><i>Data Sovereignty&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-193">When planning for geographic diversity, an 
organization might need to consider sovereignty laws governing data. For
 example, there might be national, state, or local laws that require 
hosting the data in specific locations.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m24-194"><b>Continuity of Operations Planning</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m24-195">Continuity of operations planning helps ensure trouble-free operations through an unanticipated disruption.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-196"><b><i>Tabletop Exercises</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-197">The purpose of business continuity planning tabletop 
exercises is to demonstrate the ability of one or more critical business
 processes to continue functionality after a disruption — usually within
 a specific timeframe. Some of these exercises might be related to a 
cyberattack, data corruption or loss, natural disaster, or multiple 
disruptions.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-198"><b><i>After-action Report</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-199">The after-action report is a detailed document 
summarizing the results of the tabletop exercises. It can include the 
purpose and scope, objectives, exercise type and methodology, scenario, 
participants, and results (e.g., successes, failures, workarounds, 
etc.).</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-200"><b><i>Failover</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-201">After a disruption to business operations, an 
organization might need to consider all information systems' failover to
 an alternate site. Likewise, business operations planning necessities 
to account for which services will be available during the interruption 
and how they will accommodate employees’ access to those services.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-202"><b><i>Alternate Processing Site</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-203">The alternate processing site is a site that allows 
all mission-critical or business-essential functions to be reestablished
 if there is an interruption to the primary processing site. The 
alternate processing site should withstand the continuity through the 
restoration of services to the primary processing site.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-204"><b><i>Alternate Business Practices</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-205">It might be essential for an organization to devise 
an alternate set of business practices after an interruption. For 
example, non-mission-critical personnel might be required to work from 
home, and employees might have to use other (or manual) processes for 
conducting day-to-day business until services are returned.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m24-206"><b>Business Continuity Planning Types</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m24-207">There are various types of business continuity plans. Some of these are described below.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-208"><b><i>Business Resumption Plan</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-209">Focuses on recreating the essential business process 
instead of focusing on the IT component. It is process-oriented as an 
alternative to procedural-oriented.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-210"><b><i>Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-211">Establishes senior management and headquarters after a disaster. It outlines roles and authorities.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-212"><b><i>IT Contingency Plan</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-213">Plan for systems, networks and major application retrieval procedures after interruptions.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-214"><b><i>Crisis Communication Plan</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-215">Comprises of internal and external communication 
structure and roles. Recognizes specific individuals who will 
communicate with external entities.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-216"><b><i>Cyber Incident Response Plan</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-217">Aims at malware, hackers, intrusions, attacks and 
other security issues. The response plan should include a strategy when a
 cyber incident occurs and what steps need to be taken to respond to the
 incident.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-218"><b><i>Disaster Recovery plan</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m24-219">A disaster recovery plan needs to be in place to 
ensure when a disaster occurs, which steps need to be followed in 
reaction to the disaster. These steps will include the data recovery 
procedure and will be according to the business continuity plan.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m24-232"><b>Incident Response Teams</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m24-233">An Incident Response team is a group of people from 
the organization who will respond if a cyber security incident has 
occurred. The types of cybersecurity incidents may include security 
breaches, denial of service attacks or malware infections. These 
incidents can potentially have a detrimental effect on the business's 
day-to-day operation and need to be addressed as soon as it has been 
detected.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-234">These teams are also known as the Cyber Incident 
Response Team (CIRT). This team consists of highly skilled individuals 
who are trained to handle these specific threats. A CIRT would normally 
work in conjunction with other teams to eradicate the threat and restore
 the business day to day functions as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m24-235"><b>Data Retention</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m24-236">Data retention is retaining data for a specific 
length of time as stipulated by an organization’s security policy. 
Typically, a minimum threshold is defined in the security policy, but a 
maximum threshold can also be defined. For example, many organizations 
require the retention of all audit logs for a specific amount of time. 
This data can then be used to reconstruct events during a security 
incident.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-237">Retention requests apply to information records, 
media holding private data, systems that process private data, and 
personnel with access to private data. Record retention and media 
retention is an important element of asset retention. Record retention 
includes retaining and preserving important information as long as it is
 needed and destroying it when it is no longer needed.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-238">Some laws and regulations direct the length of time 
that an organization should preserve data, such as three years, seven 
years, or even undetermined.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-239">Organizations are responsible for identifying laws 
and regulations that apply and comply with the data they need to retain.
 However, even in the absence of external requirements, an organization 
should still identify how long to retain data.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m24-240"><b><i>Data Retention Guidelines</i></b></h4>

<ul id="cn-m24-241">

<li id="cn-m24-241">Include all stakeholders in the process of supporting the business and legal necessities for the data retention policies.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-242">Formulate common objectives for supporting archiving and data retention best practices.</li>

<li id="cn-m24-243">Monitor, evaluate and apprise documented data retention policies and archiving procedures.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m24-244">A data retention policy should:</p>

<ul id="cn-m24-245">

<li id="cn-m24-245">Summarize the classification of records</li>

<li id="cn-m24-246">Preservation and destruction schedules</li>

<li id="cn-m24-247">Parties accountable for preservation and destruction</li>

<li id="cn-m24-248">Processes used for destruction</li>

<li id="cn-m24-249">Training</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m24-250">For the retained data to be useful, it should be available. Consider the following issues for data accessibility:</p>

<p id="cn-m24-251"><b>Taxonomy </b>- Scheme for classifying the data; could be functional, chronological, or a combination of categories.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-252"><b>Classification </b>- Sensitivity determines the controls we put in place during the lifecycle of the data.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-253"><b>Normalization </b>- Data comes in many forms. 
Storing data in its original format may render it unavailable later in 
time. It is practical to tag data sets to guarantee searchability and 
accessibility.</p>

<p id="cn-m24-254"><b>Indexing </b>- Indexing preserves data for future searches.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m24-255"><b>Record Retention</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m24-256">Record retention strategies guarantee that data is 
kept in a usable state while it is required and deleted when it is not. 
Many laws and regulations stipulate retaining data for a definite period
 of time, but in the absence of formal regulations, establishments 
stipulate the retention period within a policy. Audit trail information 
needs to be kept long enough to regenerate past incidents, but the 
establishments must recognize how far back they want to investigate. A 
current trend with many establishments is to minimize legal liabilities 
by applying short retention policies</p>

<p id="cn-m24-257">Data is occasionally archived to comply with laws or 
regulations, necessitating the retention of data. Moreover, valuable 
data is backed up as a basic security control to guarantee that it is 
available even if access to the original information is lost. Archives 
and backups are stored off-site. When transporting and storing this 
data, it’s significant to offer the same level of security that is 
applied during storage on-site. The level of security is dependent on 
the grouping and value of the data.</p>

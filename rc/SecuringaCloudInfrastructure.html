<p id="cn-m23-80"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m23-c-1" src="SecuringaCloudInfrastructure_files/image-m23-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-81"><b>Hypervisor</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-82">The hypervisor is a server or appliance that runs 
virtual machines (VMs). The hypervisor provides the hardware and 
software foundation for your virtual infrastructure.</p>

<ul id="cn-m23-83">

<li id="cn-m23-83"><b>Type I </b>- A type I hypervisor runs directly on 
the underlying hardware, providing virtual machines almost direct 
hardware access. It is the best performing type and provides for the 
most scalability. VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V are two of the 
leaders in this type of hypervisor.</li>

<li id="cn-m23-84"><b>Type II </b>- A type II hypervisor is a 
software-based virtualization that runs on top of an operating system, 
such as Windows or Linux. It doesn’t offer as many of the advanced 
features of a type I hypervisor, doesn’t provide as much performance, 
and doesn’t scale. However, it is useful for development and testing 
scenarios. A type II hypervisor is best suited for individual use, such 
as by developers or system administrators.</li>

<li id="cn-m23-85"><b>Application cells/containers </b>- Containers are 
another way to virtualize your application. Instead of running 
individual virtual machines, you package your app/code and dependencies 
into a single container. Containers are portable and they share a 
back-end operating system. You can run multiple containers on a single 
server and they won’t know about each other.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m23-86"><b>Cloud Storage</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-87">Cloud storage is like local storage — a bunch of disk 
drives or SSDs, sometimes connected, that store data. However, cloud 
storage is in the cloud, not on-premises and instead of deploying and 
managing the storage, you just consume it. Think of it as 
storage-as-a-service. Benefits include reduced administrative overhead 
and reduced costs. The downsides are that you lose control of the 
hardware and much of the configuration; you often can’t choose how the 
data is stored or how it is encrypted.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-88"><b>Cloud Deployment Models</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-89">When you deploy workloads to the cloud, you have your 
choice between several models. For some solutions, multiple cloud 
deployment models are feasible, and you choose based on specific 
requirements. Other times, only one cloud deployment model is feasible 
based on your goals. Many organizations, especially large enterprise 
organizations, use some of each deployment model. In other cases, 
especially with start-ups, only SaaS is used.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m23-90"><b><i>SaaS</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m23-91">Software-as-a-service (SaaS) is a very popular cloud 
service model. It has been around a very long time, even before people 
called it SaaS and used the term “the cloud.”</p>

<h4 id="cn-m23-92"><b><i>PaaS</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m23-93">Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a complete environment
 for running your apps. A typical PaaS solution includes servers, 
storage, networking, and other infrastructure and software you need to 
apply. One common example of PaaS is database-as-a-service solutions, 
such as Microsoft’s Azure SQL Database. They manage the infrastructure; 
you gain access to SQL.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m23-94"><b><i>IaaS</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m23-95">Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) provides the 
underlying components you need to run your data center in the public 
cloud. IaaS offers virtualization capabilities, virtual networking, 
storage and security services. If you only need to run VMs in the cloud,
 then you only need IaaS.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m23-96"><b><i>Private</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m23-97">A private cloud is one that is deployed on-premises 
and intended only for your organization. It often mimics a public cloud 
with virtualization and automation.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m23-98"><b><i>Public</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m23-99">A public cloud is one that is deployed in a provider’s
 environment and is intended to be a multi-customer environment. 
Resources are shared amongst customers, although customers are segmented
 from each other. Virtualization and automation provide the key backend 
foundational technologies in a public cloud.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m23-100"><b><i>Hybrid</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m23-101">A hybrid cloud combines one or more private clouds 
with one or more public clouds. For example, an organization might have 
its own private cloud build in their environment, use some VMs based in a
 service provider’s data center and SaaS solution in the public cloud. 
In such scenarios, it is common to use solutions that integrate the 
clouds as closely as possible. For example, users might authenticate to 
apps the same way regardless of whether they are in the company’s 
private cloud or in the public cloud. Similarly, all audit logs from all
 sources might be stored in the same location.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m23-102"><b><i>Community</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m23-103">A community cloud, a relatively new cloud deployment 
model, is a cloud built for a specific community, such as the legal 
industry. The environment is shared amongst multiple customers. Often, 
community clouds are considered a hybrid form of private clouds built 
and operated specifically for a targeted group.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m23-104"><b><i>On-premises vs. hosted vs. cloud</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m23-105">On-premises refer to your own server room, data 
center or office. Hosted refers to third-party data centers that provide
 segmented space for customer computing equipment; for example, you can 
rent a rack to house your servers. A cloud is like a hosted environment,
 but instead of renting a rack to put your physical servers, you 
purchase virtualized solutions, such as a database service or an IaaS 
environment.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-106"><b>VDI/VDE</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-107">Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) refers to 
virtualized client computers hosted on hypervisors and made available to
 end-users. With VDI, you have centralized management and can offer 
individual VMs to users. Virtual desktop environment (VDE) refers to a 
virtualized desktop running locally on your client computer. VDI is more
 scalable and offers remote connectivity to VMs, while VDE is a 
localized solution, typically for a very specific purpose (such as to 
use as a development or test environment).</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-108"><b>Cloud Access Security Broker</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-109">A cloud access security broker (CASB) is a security 
solution that typically is placed between your on-premises environment 
and your cloud provider’s environment. A CASB enforces your 
organization’s security policies in real-time.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-110">CASP&nbsp;provides an&nbsp;additional layer of 
security. CASB is proven to have worked well with existing solutions by 
providing layered security and control over data stored in the cloud. A 
proxy-based&nbsp;cloud access security broker&nbsp;(CASB) duplicates the
 features of a common firewall and places it between users and the 
applications they need to do their jobs. This results in a reduction in 
overall performance and user experience.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-111"><b>Security as a Service</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-112">Many organizations deploy a multi-layered security 
strategy for their environment, deploying anti-malware, auditing, 
logging, monitoring, security incident response and other services. It 
requires a lot of time, money and workforce to deploy and maintain all 
of these services. Security as a service attempts to address the 
challenge of running your own security environment by offering security 
services on a subscription basis. A provider deploys, maintains, and 
monitors the security stack while the customer consumes the provider's 
data and urgent communications.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-113"><b>High Availability Across Zones</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-114">High availability describes an environment where 
systems continue to be available regardless of what fails or how it 
fails. High availability is like fault tolerance but focuses on both 
hardware and software. High availability isn’t always instantaneous 
availability but typically strives to be as close to that as possible.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-115"><b>Cloud Application Security</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-116">Cloud application security&nbsp;provides policies, 
processes, standards, controls and procedures that control data exchange
 in collaborative cloud environments like Microsoft Office 365, Google G
 Suite, Slack, and Box.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-117"><b>Cloud Application Security Threats</b></h3>

<ul id="cn-m23-118">

<li id="cn-m23-118"><b>Misconfiguration of application setup&nbsp;</b>could allow exposure of data to the public resulting in a major data breach. The exposure could be accidental or intentional.</li>

<li id="cn-m23-119"><b>Unauthorized access&nbsp;</b>to a cloud 
application, infrastructure or platform allows attackers to perform 
malicious intent, resulting in cost and reputation damage.</li>

<li id="cn-m23-120"><b>Insecure APIs and interfaces&nbsp;</b>provide a 
lot of ways for the attackers to exploit systems. Attackers can take 
advantage of common vulnerabilities in APIs and interfaces and exploit 
the same with ease.</li>

<li id="cn-m23-121"><b>Account hijacking </b>allows&nbsp;access to 
sensitive data and resources to unauthorized users. It allows attackers 
to view and perform actions on the stored content in the cloud.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m23-122"><b>Secure Web Gateway</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-123">A secure web gateway guards an organization from 
online security threats and exploits by administering company policy and
 filtering Internet-bound traffic. A secure web gateway is a 
cloud-delivered network security service that is deployed in house and 
hence is an on-premise solution. It sits between users and the internet 
and provides advanced network protection by examining web requests 
against company policy to guarantee malicious applications and websites 
are blocked and unreachable. A secure web gateway contains crucial 
security technologies such as&nbsp;URL filtering, data loss 
prevention,&nbsp;antivirus, and https check to offer organizations with 
strong web security.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m23-124"><b><i>Benefits</i></b></h4>

<ul id="cn-m23-125">

<li id="cn-m23-125">Prevents access to high risk and dangerous websites and applications</li>

<li id="cn-m23-126">Implements regulations, processes and policies</li>

<li id="cn-m23-127">Provides layered security thus, thwarting malware attacks and identified infected systems</li>

<li id="cn-m23-128">Offers protection for remote workers by implementing
 company security policies, and enables them to stay connected wherever 
they may be</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m23-129"><b>Next Gen Secure Web Gateway </b>are cloud-based 
web security solutions that prevent malware, detect advanced threats, 
filters by category, protect data, and control app use for any user, 
location, or device. It unifies industry-leading CASB, SWG, and DLP into
 common policy controls with custom reporting and rich metadata for 
ad-hoc queries.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m23-130"><b><i>Secure Web Gateway Features</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m23-131"><b>URL Filtering</b></p>

<p id="cn-m23-132">URL Filtering&nbsp;is a web security control that 
controls access to websites based on URL to inhibit employees from 
accessing malicious or incorrect content and administering bandwidth 
limitations on streaming services. Internet traffic is moreover 
prevented or approved based on the URL category, users, groups or 
machines. With URL filtering, administrators can attain information on 
which employee is retrieving which websites, and when they gain access 
to them.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-133"><b>Application Control</b></p>

<p id="cn-m23-134">Application Control&nbsp;offers administrators the 
ability to create web security policies based on users to recognize, 
block or limit the usage of web applications and widgets. This 
guarantees that the data being used by and shared between applications 
is private and secure within an organization.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-135"><b>Data Loss Prevention</b></p>

<p id="cn-m23-136">Data Loss Prevention (DLP)&nbsp;warrants that 
critical and sensitive information is not sent outside of an 
organization’s network. Data loss prevention proactively protects your 
business from accidental loss of valuable and sensitive information by 
observing data movement and following industry compliance regulations 
and standards.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-137"><b>Antivirus</b></p>

<p id="cn-m23-138">Antivirus&nbsp;software is intended to avert, 
discover, and remove software bugs such as viruses, Trojans, and adware.
 Antivirus uses real-time virus signatures to proactively avert threats 
and achieve web security services to monitor the network for effectual 
incident response and attack resolution.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-139"><b>Https Inspection</b></p>

<p id="cn-m23-140">Https inspection on protected web gateways scans and 
safeguards SSL encrypted traffic moving through the gateway. Gateways 
using https inspection decrypt the data with the sender’s public key and
 then re-encrypt the content to send back to the sender. Encrypted data 
sent through a gateway that does not have to be analyzed, such as access
 to financial or healthcare websites, can be stopped with an 
administrator policy.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m23-141"><b><i>Secure Web Gateways and Firewalls</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m23-142">Secure web gateways and&nbsp;firewalls are alike 
because they provide progressive network protection and can categorize 
friendly vs. malicious traffic. However, secure web gateways primarily 
detect and shield against advanced Internet-based attacks using web 
traffic inspection at the application layer.</p>

<p id="cn-m23-143">Though&nbsp;Next Generation Firewalls&nbsp;also 
examine Internet traffic, these firewalls mostly use deep packet 
inspection to recognize and permit safe applications into the network, 
while stopping and controlling dangerous applications. In the future, 
the technologies and features of secure web gateways and&nbsp;Next 
Generation Firewalls&nbsp;will progress and become more concise. Both of
 these security solutions are indispensable components for any 
organization’s security architecture.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-144"><b>Cloud Firewall Considerations</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-145">Cloud firewalls block cyberattacks focused on these 
cloud assets. As the name indicates, a cloud firewall is a firewall that
 is hosted in the cloud. Cloud-based firewalls often form a virtual 
barrier around cloud platforms, infrastructure, and applications similar
 to traditional firewalls that form barriers around an organization's 
internal network. Positioning a cloud firewall is like replacing a 
bank's local security cameras and a physical security guard with a 
global 24/7 security center with a central staff and security camera.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-146"><b>Cloud Secrets Management&nbsp;</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-147">Cloud Sectrets management denotes the tools and 
techniques for&nbsp;managing&nbsp;digital authentication credentials. 
These include passwords, keys, APIs, and tokens for use in services, 
accounts with high privilege and other sensitive parts of the IT 
ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-148"><b>Cloud Storage&nbsp;</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-149">Cloud Storage is a service model in which information
 is transmitted and&nbsp;contained&nbsp;on 
remote&nbsp;storage&nbsp;systems. Here, it is preserved, managed, backed
 up and made accessible to users over a&nbsp;network.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-150"><b>Permissions Auditing and Review</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-151">Permission auditing and review confirm that only 
eligible users have access to the resources within an organization. As 
part of the process, the organization will regulate whether each user’s 
privileges to resources align with the user’s role within the 
organization. During the audit, the organization will evaluate its 
access controls' efficacy and confirm that accounts are managed 
fittingly.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-152"><b>Time-of-day Restrictions</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-153">Organizations might choose to confine a user’s access
 to resources to specific times in a day as well as days of the week. 
For example, to decrease security vulnerabilities, an organization could
 define a policy limiting a user’s access to resources to business hours
 only. As an outcome, the user will not have access to resources during 
non-business hours.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-154"><b>Usage Auditing and Review</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-155">Usage auditing and review is the method of recording 
the actions users perform on resources within an organization. As part 
of the process, the organization will conclude whether each user’s 
actions line up with the user’s privileges and roles within the 
organization.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-156"><b>Virtualization </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-157">Virtualization is the core technology for cloud computing. The following are the resource pools that support virtualization:</p>

<ul id="cn-m23-158">

<li id="cn-m23-158">Compute</li>

<li id="cn-m23-159">Network</li>

<li id="cn-m23-160">Storage</li>

<li id="cn-m23-161">Containers</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m23-162"><b>Compute</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-163">Compute virtualization abstracts the running of code.
 Instead of running on the hardware directly, the code runs on top of an
 abstraction layer thus, providing more flexibility such as running 
multiple operating systems on the same hardware.  Compute commonly 
refers to virtual machines.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-164"><b>Network</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-165">Most cloud computing uses <b>Software Defined Networking </b>(<b>SDN</b>) for virtualizing networks. <b>SDN </b>abstracts
 network management from underlying physical infrastructure. Virtual 
networks are different from physical networks. They run on physical 
networks but abstraction allows for modification that impacts security 
and underlying features.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m23-166"><b>Cloud Resource Policies</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m23-167">Cloud resource policies can be grouped into the following categories:</p>

<p id="cn-m23-173">Admission control aims to ensure systems do not 
accept data that do not conform to policies. Capacity allocation 
allocates memory to resources. Load balancing and energy optimization 
are related and may have an impact on the cost of offering services. 
Load balancing ensures even distribution of load to a set of servers. 
Quality of service is challenging to address but is significant as most 
applications and services require high performance.</p>

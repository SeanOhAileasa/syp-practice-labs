<p id="cn-m31-100">Risk refers to the likelihood of exploitation of a 
vulnerability. There are different types of risks based on the attack 
factors and threat agents. Risk management strategies aim to minimize 
threats.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-101">In this exercise, risk types and risk management strategies will be discussed.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-109"><b>Learn the Process of Identifying and Assessing Risk</b></h3>

<h4 id="cn-m31-110"><b><i>What is a Risk?</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-111">Risk refers to the possibility or likelihood that a threat would exploit a vulnerability.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-112"><b>Risk = Threat * Vulnerability</b></p>

<h4 id="cn-m31-113"><b><i>Risk Types</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-114"><b>Internal Vs. External</b></p>

<p id="cn-m31-115">Internal risks are risks that an organization can 
control. For example, an organization might assess the risk of 
implementing a web application firewall to ensure that the applications 
are not directly exposed to the internet. On the other hand, external 
risks cannot be controlled by the organization. For example, an 
organization cannot control natural disasters that could affect the 
organization's systems.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-116"><b>Multiparty</b></p>

<p id="cn-m31-117">The involvement of a larger number of parties 
increases the impact of risks since each party has different objectives.
 Conventional risk management techniques might not be the solution for 
multiparty risks. Risk responses taken by one party may introduce 
additional risks to the organization. A systematic process of managing 
risks in a multiparty environment is thus required.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-118"><b>Intellectual Property Theft</b></p>

<p id="cn-m31-119">Intellectual property refers to copyrights, 
trademarks, patents, trade secrets, brand names, etc., that an 
organization holds. Failure to protect intellectual property could 
result in costly damage to the organization.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-120"><b>Software Compliance / Licensing</b></p>

<p id="cn-m31-121">Most often, organizations use third-party licensing 
solutions to manage licenses. Such solutions are effective in 
identifying the license requirements and compliance information. It also
 aids in configuration management that allows the figuring out the total
 number of licenses installed against the license procured.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m31-122"><b><i>Risk Terminologies</i></b></h4>

<ul id="cn-m31-123">

<li id="cn-m31-123">An <b>asset </b>is anything that has value.</li>

<li id="cn-m31-124">A <b>threat </b>is a potential occurrence that may cause undesirable outcomes or harm to an asset.</li>

<li id="cn-m31-125">An entity that takes advantage of a vulnerability is called a <b>threat agent</b>.</li>

<li id="cn-m31-126"><b>Vulnerability </b>refers to a weakness in a system.</li>

<li id="cn-m31-127"><b>Exposure </b>is being susceptible to a loss because of a vulnerability.</li>

<li id="cn-m31-128">Anything that removes or reduces the severity of a vulnerability and protects the assets against a threat is called a <b>safeguard.</b></li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m31-131"><b><i>Risk Management Strategies</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-132"><b>Risk </b>assessment identifies vulnerabilities and
 threats and assesses the possible repercussions to decide where to 
implement the security controls.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-134"><b>Handling Risks</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-135"><b>Risk acceptance </b>refers to not take any action against the identified risk and accept it as it is.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-136"><b>Risk avoidance </b>terminates the activity that introduces the risk.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-137">When a risk is transferred to another entity, it is referred to as <b>risk transfer.</b></p>

<p id="cn-m31-138">When controls or safeguards are put in place to eliminate vulnerabilities and threats, it is called <b>risk mitigation.</b></p>

<p id="cn-m31-139"><b>Risk rejection </b>refers to recognizing the risk element and not taking any action to address it.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-140"><b>Cybersecurity insurance </b>is usually provided to
 organizations to protect them from the effects and consequences of 
vulnerabilities and threats, thereby reducing risks.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-141"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m31-c-3" src="OrganizationalRiskManagementandPolicies_files/image-m31-c-3.jpg" alt="Figure 1.2: Showing a diagrammatic representation of the Risk management strategies; Reduce or Mitigate the Risk, Risk Assignment or Transfer, Risk Acceptance, Risk Avoidance and Risk Rejection or Ignore."><figcaption>Figure

<h3 id="cn-m31-172"><b>Risk Analysis</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-173">Risk assessment is the method of identifying 
vulnerabilities, whereas a risk analysis is carried out after a risk 
assessment to ensure security is cost-effective, relevant and responsive
 to threats. A risk analysis helps prioritize risks, shows how to deduce
 the largest risks, and how to optimally deal with said risks.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-174">There are two types of risk analysis:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-175">

<li id="cn-m31-175">Quantitative risk analysis</li>

<li id="cn-m31-176">Qualitative risk analysis</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m31-177"><b><i>Quantitative Risk Analysis</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-178">Quantitative risk analysis is monetary in nature. It 
assigns numeric values to the elements of the risk analysis. It is a 
mathematical approach for conducting risk analysis. It is often easy to 
understand because it uses risk calculations to predict the monetary 
loss for threats.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-179">The six common steps used in quantitative risk analysis are shown in the below image:</p>

<p id="cn-m31-182"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m31-c-7" src="OrganizationalRiskManagementandPolicies_files/image-m31-c-7.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1: Showing the quantitative risk analysis steps, Assign Asset Value, Calculate Exposure Factor, Calculate Single Loss Expectancy, Assess Annualized Rate of Occurrence, Derive Annualized Loss Expectancy and Perform Cost/Benefit Analysis Counter Measure."><figcaption>Figure

Calculate Exposure Factor, Calculate Single Loss Expectancy, Assess 
Annualized Rate of Occurrence, Derive Annualized Loss Expectancy and

<p id="cn-m31-184">Below are the key terms used in quantitative risk analysis:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-185">

<li id="cn-m31-185">Exposure Factor (EF)</li>

<li id="cn-m31-186">Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)</li>

<li id="cn-m31-187">Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ALO)</li>

<li id="cn-m31-188">Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)</li>

<li id="cn-m31-189">Annual Cost of Safeguards (ACS)</li>

<h4 id="cn-m31-192"><b><i>Qualitative Risk Analysis</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-193">Qualitative risk analysis is considered to be a much 
softer approach to risk analysis. It does not quantify anything, nor 
does it use calculations but is opinion-based. The risk is often 
concluded through judgment, intuition, best practices and experience.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-194">Some common methods used for qualitative risk analysis are as follows:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-195">

<li id="cn-m31-195">Brainstorming</li>

<li id="cn-m31-196">Delphi Technique</li>

<li id="cn-m31-197">Storyboarding</li>

<li id="cn-m31-198">Focus Groups</li>

<li id="cn-m31-199">Surveys</li>

<li id="cn-m31-200">Questionnaire’s</li>

<li id="cn-m31-201">Checklists</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m31-204"><b>Quantitative vs. Qualitative Risk Analysis</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-205">You can either utilize <b>Qualitative </b>or <b>Quantitative </b>risk analysis methods, both having their strengths and weaknesses. <b>Qualitative </b>risk
 analysis typically uses a high degree of guesswork. It is based on the 
opinions of the individuals completing the analysis. In contrast, <b>Quantitative </b>uses
 a vast array of data to arrive at an outcome, although it can be 
difficult without the correct tools and processes in place.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-206"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m31-c-10" src="OrganizationalRiskManagementandPolicies_files/image-m31-c-10.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4: Shows a diagram in which both quantitative and qualitative risk analyses are compared and contrasted."><figcaption>Figure 2.4: Shows a diagram in which both quantitative and qualitative risk analyses are compared and contrasted.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<h4 id="cn-m31-208"><b><i>Total Risk and Residual Risk</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-209">Total risk is the combination of threats, 
vulnerabilities and asset value. Residual risk is the risk left after a 
safeguard is implemented.</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-210">

<li id="cn-m31-210">Total Risk = Threats * Vulnerability * Asset Value</li>

<li id="cn-m31-211">Residual Risk = (Threats * Vulnerability * Asset Value) * Control Gaps</li>

<li id="cn-m31-212">Residual Risk = Total Risk - Countermeasures</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m31-213"><b><i>Risk Register</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-214">A risk register is a document maintained by an 
organization during a risk assessment to track issues and address 
problems as they arise.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m31-215"><b><i>Risk Matrix/Heat Map </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-216">A&nbsp;risk map, also called a&nbsp;risk heat map, is
 a tool for communicating specific&nbsp;risks&nbsp;an organization 
faces. A&nbsp;risk map&nbsp;helps organizations identify and prioritize 
the&nbsp;risks.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-217"><b>Risk appetite</b></p>

<p id="cn-m31-218">Risk appetite refers to the level of risk an organization is prepared to accept.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-219"><b>Risk awareness</b></p>

<p id="cn-m31-220">Risk awareness refers to accepting risk(s) and taking steps to reduce or eliminate the identified risk(s).</p>

<p id="cn-m31-221"><b>Regulations that affect risk posture</b></p>

<p id="cn-m31-222">Many organizations, such as those in the financial 
and healthcare sectors, must conform with several government regulations
 for customer data security and privacy in their industry. Organizations
 must be attentive in creating their policies to abide by these 
regulations and should employ risk mitigation techniques to evade 
violating these strict standards. Some of these regulations are PCI-DSS,
 HIPAA, SOX, etc.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-223">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA). HIPAA is a set of compliance regulations for protecting 
confidential patient data in the medical, health care, and health 
insurance industries.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-224">The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) defines standards for 
publicly held companies and accounting firms for storage, access, 
communications, and financial data auditing in the financial services 
industry.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-225">The Payment Card Industry (PCI) is a set of standards for companies that process credit card information to help prevent fraud.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-226"><b>Likelihood of occurrence</b></p>

<p id="cn-m31-227">The likelihood of occurrence is the probability that a
 specific risk will occur. The value can be expressed as a fraction 
between 0 and 1 or as a percentage.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-228"><b>Impact</b></p>

<p id="cn-m31-229">The impact of a risk is the consequences if it occurs (i.e., the cost of a risk).</p>

<p id="cn-m31-230"><b>Asset value</b></p>

<p id="cn-m31-231">As part of a risk assessment, an organization will 
evaluate the value of assets. The value assigned to an asset is specific
 and considers tangible costs (e.g., purchase cost) as well as 
intangible costs (e.g., reputation).</p>

<p id="cn-m31-236">Business continuity is a process that helps maintain 
the continuous operation of business-critical functions in the event of a
 disaster. The main goal of disaster recovery and business continuity 
plans is to minimize the immediate effects of a disaster.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-237">In this exercise, disasters and business impact analysis will be discussed.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m31-239">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-240">

<li id="cn-m31-240">Business Continuity and Disasters</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m31-243"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m31-c-11" src="OrganizationalRiskManagementandPolicies_files/image-m31-c-11.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-245"><b>Business Continuity and Disasters</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-246">There are four main steps in business continuity planning:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-247">

<li id="cn-m31-247">Project scope and planning</li>

<li id="cn-m31-248">Business Impact Assessment (BIA)</li>

<li id="cn-m31-249">Continuity planning</li>

<li id="cn-m31-250">Approval and Implementation</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m31-251"><b><i>Nature of Disasters</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-252">Disasters can be natural (environmental) or 
human-made. Natural disasters result from a change in the earth’s 
surface or the environment and are out of human control. Examples of 
natural disasters are hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, storms etc. 
Human-made disasters occur intentionally or unintentionally. Some 
examples of human-made disasters are terrorism, bombings or explosions, 
network or infrastructure failures, hardware failures and software 
failures.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-253">Three main types of disruptions are:</p>

<p id="cn-m31-254"><b>Non-disaster </b>- Disruption in a service that has a significant but limited impact on the conduct of business operations</p>

<p id="cn-m31-255"><b>Disaster </b>- An event that causes the entire facility to be unusable for a day or longer</p>

<p id="cn-m31-256"><b>Catastrophe </b>- Major disruptions that destroys the facility altogether</p>

<h4 id="cn-m31-257"><b><i>Single Point of Failure</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-258">A single point of failure is any component that can 
cause an entire system to fail. If a system has data on a single disk, 
the disk's failure can cause the system to fail, so the disk is a single
 point of failure.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m31-259"><b><i>Business Impact Analysis</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-260">Business impact analysis is also termed functional 
analysis. A business impact analysis identifies critical resources to 
the organization and the threats posed by these resources. It assesses 
the likelihood that each threat will actually occur and the impact of 
those threats. The result helps in prioritizing the commitment of 
Business continuity resources to various risk exposures.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-261">There are eight important steps for conducting business impact analysis:</p>

<p id="cn-m31-262">1. Select individuals for data gathering</p>

<p id="cn-m31-263">2. Create a data-gathering technique</p>

<p id="cn-m31-264">3. Identify company critical business functions</p>

<p id="cn-m31-265">4. Identify what these resource functions depend on</p>

<p id="cn-m31-266">5. Calculate how long functions can survive without said resources</p>

<p id="cn-m31-267">6. Identify vulnerabilities and threats to functions</p>

<p id="cn-m31-268">7. Calculate the risk for each business function</p>

<p id="cn-m31-269">8. Document/report the findings to management</p>

<p id="cn-m31-270"><b>Recovery Time Objective (RTO) </b>is the amount of time you think you can feasibly recover the function in the event of a disruption.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-271"><b>Recovery Point Objective (RPO) </b>is the amount of data loss or system inaccessibility that an organization can withstand.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-272">MTD is the maximum length of time a business function can be inoperable without causing irreparable harm. <b>The Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) </b>provides valuable information when performing Business Continuity Planning and Disaster Recovery Planning.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-273"><b>The Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) </b>defines how 
long it will take to recuperate a particular failed system. It is the 
best approximation for reconstructing the IT system so that business 
continuity may happen. <b>Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) </b>quantifies
 how extended a new or corrected system will run before failing. It is 
usually produced by a component vendor and is mostly applicable to 
hardware as opposed to applications and software.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m31-275"><b><i>Disaster Recovery Planning</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-276">In an attempt to recover from a disaster, the following are given utmost importance:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-277">

<li id="cn-m31-277">Identification of critical business functions</li>

<li id="cn-m31-278">Backups and Offsite Storage</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m31-279"><b>Full Backup</b>:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-280">

<li id="cn-m31-280">All data is backed up and recovery is just a one-step process. However, the backup and recovery process can take a long time.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m31-281"><b>Differential Backup</b>:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-282">

<li id="cn-m31-282">Backups the files that have been modified since the last full backup</li>

<li id="cn-m31-283">When data needs to be recovered, the full backup is 
put in place first; then, the very recent differential backup is placed 
on top of the full backup</li>

<li id="cn-m31-284">Takes quite some time in the backing up stage but takes less time for restoration</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m31-285"><b>Incremental Backup</b>:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-286">

<li id="cn-m31-286">Backups all files that have been altered since the last full or incremental backup</li>

<li id="cn-m31-287">Takes less time to backup when compared to differential backup but takes more time for recovery</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m31-288"><b><i>Alternate Processing Sites</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-289">A <b>hot site </b>will have all adequate hardware and
 critical applications and data mirrored in real-time. A hot site will 
have the capacity to allow the organization to continue critical 
operations within a very short period of time, sometimes in less than an
 hour. A <b>warm site </b>is a leased or rented facility that is typically incompletely configured with some equipment but not the real computers. A <b>redundant site </b>obtains
 data backups in real-time so that there is no loss of data in the 
occurrence of a disaster. There is no such term as a duplicate site. A <b>cold site </b>does
 not contain backup copies of data, nor does it encompass any instantly 
available hardware. After a disruptive incident, a cold site will take 
the longest amount of time of all the recovery solutions to the device 
and recover critical IT services for the organization. It is also 
considered the least expensive recovery solution. A <b>mobile site </b>is
 a good fit for disasters such as a data-center flood where the 
data-center is damaged, but the rest of the facilities and surrounding 
property are intact.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-290">A <b>reciprocal agreement </b>is formalized in the 
form of a contract written to obtain support from outside organizations 
in the occurrence of a disaster. They are also called Mutual Aid 
Agreements (MAAs) and are organized so that each organization will 
support the other in an emergency. All other options are made-up terms.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m31-291"><b><i>Database Recovery Techniques</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-292"><b>Disk Duplexing</b>:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-293">

<li id="cn-m31-293">More than one disk controller will be in use.</li>

<li id="cn-m31-294">Upon failure of one controller, the other one is available instantly.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m31-296"><b>Disk Shadowing</b>:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-297">

<li id="cn-m31-297">Data is dynamically generated and maintained on two or more alike disks.</li>

<li id="cn-m31-298">Used to guarantee the availability of data and to 
offer a fault-tolerant solution by replicating hardware and sustaining 
more than one copy of the information</li>

<li id="cn-m31-299">It offers online backup storage</li>

<li id="cn-m31-300">It can enhance read operation performance</li>

<li id="cn-m31-301">It is a costly solution because two or more hard drives are used to contain the exact same data</li>

<li id="cn-m31-302">Companies opt for this model if fault tolerance is necessary</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m31-304"><b>Electronic Vaulting:</b></p>

<ul id="cn-m31-305">

<li id="cn-m31-305">Creates copies of files as they are generated or altered and periodically transmits them to an offsite backup site</li>

<li id="cn-m31-306">An approach for transferring bulk data to offsite facilities for backup</li>

<li id="cn-m31-307">The transmission happens in a phased manner</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m31-309"><b>Remote Journaling:</b></p>

<ul id="cn-m31-310">

<li id="cn-m31-310">This is an approach for transmitting data offsite, 
usually by moving the journal or transaction logs to the offsite 
facility and not the real files. These logs include the delta that has 
taken place on the actual files</li>

<li id="cn-m31-311">Journaling is effective for database recovery, where
 only the reapplication of a sequence of changes to individual records 
is necessary to resynchronize the database.</li>

<li id="cn-m31-312">It takes place instantaneously and transmits the file deltas</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m31-314"><b>Business Resumption Plan </b>- Focuses on 
recreating the necessary business process instead of focusing on IT 
Component. It is process-oriented instead of procedural-oriented.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-315"><b>Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) </b>- Establishes senior management and a headquarters after a disaster and outlines roles and authorities, orders of succession.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-316"><b>IT Contingency Plan </b>- Plan for systems, networks and major application recovery procedures after disruptions.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-317"><b>Crisis Communication Plan </b>- Consist of 
internal and external roles and communication structure. Identified 
specific individuals who will interact with external entities.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m31-321"><b>Exercise 4 - Personnel Controls</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m31-322">Several organizations put different types of security
 controls in place to protect and safeguard their data. Other than the 
security controls, several security methods are used to ensure that 
there is no threat generating from inside the system. Organizations use 
various methods, such as mandatory vacations and job rotations, to 
protect the data from such internal threats. In this exercise, different
 methods of personnel controls will be discussed.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m31-324">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m31-339">This exercise contains supporting materials for Security+.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-340"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m31-c-12" src="OrganizationalRiskManagementandPolicies_files/image-m31-c-12.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-342"><b>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-343">As the name suggests, AUP defines what is appropriate
 for a user to do in the context of the IT systems. It defines some of 
the key aspects of IT system and network usage, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-344">

<li id="cn-m31-344">The level of usage of the IT systems and network</li>

<li id="cn-m31-345">The definition of appropriate usage of the IT systems and network</li>

<li id="cn-m31-346">What is user prohibited to do</li>

<li id="cn-m31-347">The type of software which should or should not be used</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m31-348">AUP intends to define the appropriate behavior of a 
user when using the IT systems and network. For example, the user should
 NOT download and install any pirated applications. Another example is 
clearly defining that the organization’s email should only be used for 
official purposes.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-349"><b>Job Rotation</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-350">An organization may also opt for the job rotation 
policy, which allows it to switch users between jobs or tasks. For 
example, if John was performing a certain task, Josh might be assigned 
to do the same task while John is moved to another task. The purpose of 
job rotation is to detect fraud or any undesirable activities.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-351"><b>Mandatory Vacation</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-352">Several organizations use a mandatory vacation policy
 to send a person on leave and allow someone else to perform the same 
task. The mandatory vacation policy intends to detect fraud and perform 
an audit of the activities that have been performed. An audit in the 
absence of the task owner helps the organization discover if any illicit
 activities may have been performed.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-353"><b>Separation of Duties</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-354">The Separation of Duties policy is commonly applied 
in most organizations to prevent fraud or illicit activities. This 
policy intends to avoid giving complete authority to one individual. For
 example, as an employee, if you submit a reimbursement voucher, it goes
 to your manager, who approves it. After your manager, it is the 
department head who needs to approve it.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-355"><b>Least Privilege</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-356">The least privilege policy defines that a user should
 have only the level of privileges required to perform a specific task. 
No user should be given any extra privileges just because of their role 
or superiority within the organization. For example, if a user needs to 
only view graphics in a repository on a file server, then the user 
should only have read-only privileges.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-357"><b>Clean Desk Space</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-358">Most users often have their desks cluttered with 
papers and other material. The clean desk policy intends to ensure that 
all papers and other materials are removed when they are not being used.
 Also, when a user moves out of the desk, the papers, specifically 
confidential documents, should be removed from the desk and locked up in
 a safe enclosure.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-360"><b>Background Checks</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-361">Every organization hires new individuals. The 
background policy intends to ensure that the individual has a clean 
track record. With the help of background checks, the human resources 
(HR) team can identify if the individual has any type of criminal 
history. In most cases, the consent is taken from the person being hired
 as an employee. The person must fill in documentation and provide 
supporting documents, which are then verified using the background check
 process. Most organizations hire an external agency that is specialized
 in background checks.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-362"><b>Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-363">As part of an organization, you may require an 
external vendor to work with you. However, before any information is 
shared with the vendor, you need to get the NDA signed. An NDA requires 
you and the vendor, both the parties, to agree that any confidential 
information of either of the parties should not be disclosed. An NDA may
 also require removing information after the project or a specific task 
is over. It prohibits either party from sharing confidential information
 with third parties without written consent. It also defines the meaning
 of confidential information. An NDA can be unilateral, which means that
 one party defines the terms. It could also be bi-lateral, which means 
both parties share confidential information and are equally responsible 
for the terms and conditions. The third type is multilateral, in which 
one party discloses the confidential information, and two or more 
parties commit not to misuse it or share it with any third party.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-364"><b>Social Media Analysis</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-365">When an organization is in the process of hiring a 
new employee, it is not always possible to determine their behavior and 
personality through the interview process. Organizations can use social 
media, for example, Twitter or Facebook, to get a clearer picture of the
 potential employee’s personality traits and behavior. A good example is
 that if the individual posts inappropriate pictures or comments, it can
 lead the employer to not employ the individual.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-366"><b>Onboarding</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-367">Imagine that an organization hires you. On your first
 day, you have no clue what to do and whom to contact. The HR team is 
too busy to help you out. This can be an issue for the hired individual,
 which is you in this case. It also adds a negative impression on the 
organization. The HR teams in most organizations have onboard processes 
and procedures, which help the individual settle down. The onboarding 
processes also include the IT part. When you complete your joining 
formalities, the IT team creates your user account, provides role-based 
permissions, and assigns you a system, which can be a desktop or a 
laptop.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-368"><b>Offboarding</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-369">Just like onboarding, the HR team usually has 
offboarding processes and procedures. IT again plays a critical role. 
For example, the IT team will disable or delete the user accounts, take 
handover of your system and other devices, such as a mobile phone. As 
part of the offboarding process, a user may be required to complete 
documentation that serves as an input for the next employee who will 
replace the user.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-370"><b>User Training</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-371">Training is critical for nurturing your employees. 
You would find training to be present in all operations of your 
organization. For example, when you join, there is an induction program 
run by the HR team. The IT team may put you through security training to
 help you safeguard your information. An organization may use different 
types of training methods. Let’s look at some of the key training 
methods.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m31-372"><b><i>Gamification</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-373">Gamification is one of the last training methods that
 are now being widely used. You have to attend the training and answer 
some questions. Based on your performance in training, you get some type
 of reward in the form of badges. For example, you have a Learning 
Management System (LMS) in your organization. You have been asked to 
attend the Security Foundations course and attempt a quiz. If you pass 
the quiz, you get a badge or any other type of reward, such as a coin. 
Some organizations provide several benefits in exchange for badges.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m31-374"><b><i>Capture-the-Flag</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-375">Capture-the-flag events are mostly security training.
 You have to perform certain activities to capture a flag. You might be 
asked to play the role of a hacker, which is a red team and penetrate 
the network. You may also be asked to defend the network from the red 
team by playing as part of the blue team. The more flags you capture, 
the more points you gain. You have to attempt to gather maximum points.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m31-376"><b><i>Phishing Campaigns</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-377">Organizations have started to test their user 
security posture by running phishing campaigns, which allow them to send
 fake phishing emails to internal employees. The intent is to send out 
phishing emails to the employees and click on the embedded links. After 
the users click, they may be taken to a website where they enter their 
credentials. The security team wants to track users who are easy prey 
for hackers.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m31-378"><b><i>Computer-based Training (CBT)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-379">If you have watched one or more YouTube videos, you 
have attended the computer-based training. In the old training style, 
you had to get into a classroom and then attend the training. 
Computer-based training gives you a free hand, and you can attend this 
training at your own will and in your free time. You can also purchase 
online courses with no instructor, but you have to attend the training, 
either delivered via a program or through videos.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m31-380"><b><i>Role-based Training</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m31-381">Role-based training is designed to train users based 
on their roles or functions within the organization. For example, if a 
user is promoted to the project manager role, the user is put through 
project management training. You may also have vendors connecting to 
your network. They are put in IT training to ensure that they follow the
 defined processes and procedures.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-382"><b>Diversity of Training Techniques</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-383">Different users within an organization may have 
different training needs. For example, a user may not like to sit 
through the classroom training. You can use CBT training to train the 
user. It may not be possible every time, but the organization should 
have different training methods to train their users. It is also about 
the time when users are expected to undergo training. If the programming
 team is busy on a critical million-dollar project, they should not be 
forced to undergo the training.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-405"><b>Vendors</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-406">Vendors are external, third-party entities that will 
often connect with your network or have access to your data. You may 
also have an external team sitting on the premises of your organization.
 Following entities can be considered as vendors:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-407">

<li id="cn-m31-407">IT hardware and software supplier</li>

<li id="cn-m31-408">Travel desk from another organization</li>

<li id="cn-m31-409">A visiting consultant</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m31-410">With the vendors, the organization and its users must
 understand the associated risks. They may have access to your data, and
 therefore, enough security controls and policies should be in place to 
safeguard your data. For example, if an external consultant is visiting 
your office, they may not be allowed to plug in their laptop to the 
network.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-411"><b>Supply Chain</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-412">Supply chain is a process in which an organization 
creates a product. In this process, you may have only the internal 
people involved or have external entities working with the internal 
team. For example, your organization creates a game, which is shipped to
 the customers via DVDs. A vendor is responsible for collecting the 
boxes of DVDs to deliver to the end-users or the dealers.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-413">It is not easy to implement security processes in the
 supply chain. You have to implement internal security processes and 
policies and focus on implementing the same for the external vendors. 
For example, you may have a documented process to allow the vendor to 
enter only a specific part of the premise. Then, the vendor must have a 
badge issued to get into that particular part.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-414"><b>Business Partners</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-415">Your organization may also have business partners 
with whom you need to share information. To do this, you need to 
establish a secure channel for sharing information. For example, you can
 implement a site-to-site VPN to securely share information. You should 
monitor the VPN connections and enable auditing to ensure that the 
business partner only accesses relevant data. There should be an 
agreement to define the data to be shared between both parties.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-416"><b>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-417">A Service Level Agreement or SLA is a document that 
defines the required service level from a service provider. There are 
measurable criteria that must be met to keep the services at an optimal 
level. For example, if you hire an external IT company to manage your IT
 infrastructure, you will define an SLA that will contain various 
clauses with measurable criteria, such as server uptime to be 99.999. 
The SLA document may also contain a penalty clause imposed on the 
service provider if the required services do not meet the defined 
criteria.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-418"><b>Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-419">A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is an agreement 
signed between two parties for a mutual benefit. An MoU does not have 
any legal binding, and therefore, it is used when two or more parties 
want to work together for a specific purpose. It can also be called the 
informal letter of intent, which defines the intent of both parties. An 
MoU is usually between two parties. If there are three parties involved,
 it is called a tri-party MoU.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-420"><b>Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-421">An MSA helps you evaluate and assess a measurement 
system used to make a business decision. To ensure that the measurement 
system itself is accurate, you use the MSA to evaluate it. Most 
organizations use a measurement system to make their business decision. 
However, the organization may end up making wrong business decisions if 
the measurement system is inaccurate. You can use MSA to ensure that the
 measurement system is accurate by assessing it thoroughly.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-422"><b>Business Partnership Agreement (BPA)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-423">When two or more partners join a partnership, you 
need to use the business partnership agreement. It is a legal document 
that is used between the partners. Some of the key components of BPA 
are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-424">

<li id="cn-m31-424">Stakes of each partner</li>

<li id="cn-m31-425">Terms</li>

<li id="cn-m31-426">Conditions</li>

<li id="cn-m31-427">Expectations of each partner</li>

<li id="cn-m31-428">Decision-making authority of a partner</li>

<li id="cn-m31-429">Contingency arrangements</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m31-430"><b>End-of-Life (EOL)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-431">Each system or software has end-of-life. Your 
organization is not going to develop every application they use 
internally. The organization will purchase and use various off-the-shelf
 applications. However, each application, such as an operating system, 
has end-of-life. When end-of-life occurs, the developer organization, 
such as Microsoft, stops selling. They expect the users to upgrade to 
the new versions, which is always recommended for usability and security
 purposes.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-432">For example, if you are using Office 2010, it had 
reached its end-of-life on October 13, 2020. The developer organization 
makes an advanced announcement with sufficient time in hand for the 
users to switch to the newer version. However, the existing product 
continues to function.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-433"><b>End of Service (EOS)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-434">After the EOL, the developer organization will stop 
providing support for the product. In many cases, EOL and EOS can both 
take place on the same date. For example, for Office 2010, EOL and EOS 
occurred on October 13, 2020. The developer organization then does not 
provide any updates or upgrades.  For an organization, they should plan 
to upgrade the older applications that have reached EOL and EOS.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-435"><b>Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-436">As part of an organization, you may require an 
external vendor to work with you. However, before any information is 
shared with the vendor, you need to get the NDA signed. An NDA requires 
you and the vendor to agree that any confidential information of either 
of the parties should not be disclosed. An NDA may also require removing
 information after the project or a specific task is over. It prohibits 
either party from sharing confidential information with third parties 
without written consent. It also defines the meaning of confidential 
information. An NDA can be unilateral, which means that one party 
defines the terms. It could also be bi-lateral, which means both parties
 share confidential information and are equally responsible for the 
terms and conditions. The third type is multilateral, in which one party
 discloses the confidential information, and two or more parties commit 
not to misuse it or share it with any third party.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m31-439"><b>Exercise 6 - Data Management</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m31-440">Each organization has some type of confidential and 
sensitive information, such as vendor contracts or employee information.
 The organization needs to use different methods to ensure proper data 
management, which eventually leads to secure data. The data must be 
properly classified and then accordingly safeguarded. For example, there
 will be some information that can be public, such as marketing material
 or the price list. Others may be internal or restricted.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-441">In this exercise, you will learn about various data 
management methods that can be used to safeguard confidential and 
sensitive data.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m31-443">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-444">

<li id="cn-m31-444">Classification</li>

<li id="cn-m31-446">Retention</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<h3 id="cn-m31-451"><b>Classification</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-452">To properly safeguard the data, an organization 
should define the data classification policy, differentiating the data 
types and how each type needs to be secured. Even though different 
organizations can classify data differently, the most widely used 
classifications are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-453">

<li id="cn-m31-453"><b>Public</b>: can be put on a Website or shared 
with other people, such as external users or customers. This type of 
data can be publicly disclosed without any security risk. An example of 
such type is marketing material and product price list.</li>

<li id="cn-m31-454"><b>Internal</b>: is restricted to only internal use.
 The internal users have access to this type of data. An example is an 
organizational chart.</li>

<li id="cn-m31-455"><b>Confidential</b>: is in control of a few users. 
There may be an adverse effect on internal operations if such data is 
leaked to the public. An example is vendor contracts.</li>

<li id="cn-m31-456"><b>Restricted</b>: is highly sensitive and 
confidential. If this type of data is leaked to the public, it may put 
the organization at legal and financial risk. An example is the credit 
card information of customers.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m31-457"><b>Governance</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-458">Data governance is a method of safeguarding the data 
by using processes, policies, user roles, and different types of 
metrics. Data governance is driven by the data governance policy, which 
controls the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-459">

<li id="cn-m31-459">Actions on the data</li>

<li id="cn-m31-460">Who can take actions</li>

<li id="cn-m31-461">Which type of data</li>

<li id="cn-m31-462">Which type of methods</li>

<li id="cn-m31-463">The procedures used to manage data</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m31-464">The data governance policy may be driven by certain 
rules and regulations, such as PCI-DSS or HIPAA, which define how the 
data should be collected, stored, used, and discarded.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-465"><b>Retention</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-466">Data retention policy defines how long an 
organization can retain data. It could be due to law or regulation that 
an organization may have to retain data. For example, your organization 
may be required to retain data for up to seven years.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-467">Organizations cannot retain data forever due to space
 and financial constraints. Therefore, the data retention policy also 
defines how to dispose of the data after its retention time.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m31-471"><b>Exercise 7 - Credential Policies</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m31-472">In a domain environment, it is always good to store 
the password on a centralized server. The applications and databases 
should not store the password locally. As an organization, you need to 
have credential policies in place. These policies define how the 
passwords will be stored, whether they will be encrypted or not, and 
whether the authentication process is encrypted.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-473">In this exercise, you will learn about different credential policies.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m31-475">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-476">

<li id="cn-m31-477">Third-party</li>

<li id="cn-m31-478">Devices</li>

<p id="cn-m31-482">This exercise contains supporting materials for Security+.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-483"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m31-c-15" src="OrganizationalRiskManagementandPolicies_files/image-m31-c-15.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-484"><b>Personnel</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-485">Users are a key part of a networked environment. 
Users can access networked applications or authenticate themselves, and 
they need to have user credentials, including a username and a password.
 A domain controller maintains the database of all users that have been 
created on it. When a user authenticates, the user credentials are 
verified against the database on the domain controller.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-486">In a network environment, you will also have 
applications, which may have their authentication schema. You should 
always attempt to integrate them with a directory service, such as 
Active Directory and use single sign-on. If possible, the users should 
be authenticated using multi-factor authentication.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-487">All such information must be documented. You should 
have policies that define the password age, number of invalid log-on 
attempts, and lockout duration. Active Directory allows you to force 
such policies on the user accounts using Group Policies.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-488"><b>Third-party </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-489">You may also have third-party accounts that connect 
to your network. To ensure that the third-party accounts are not 
misused, you should enable two-factor or multifactor authentication. If 
you are using a directory service, you should keep the third-party 
accounts in a separate container, such as an Organizational Unit, and 
impose strict policies. Different organizations have different security 
policies for managing third-party accounts. Whichever practice is 
followed, it must be documented and implemented, for example, using 
Group Policies.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-490"><b>Devices</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-491">You may need more policies for devices like mobiles 
and tablets that may connect to your network. The device policies that 
you create may include some of the key pointers, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-492">

<li id="cn-m31-492">Deploy a certificate on each device that should identify the device to be a trusted hardware</li>

<li id="cn-m31-493">Implement screen locks or some form of authentication, such as fingerprints</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m31-494">An organization can use other methods, such as Mobile
 Device Management (MDM), to manage these devices. You can use features 
like remote wipe, geolocation, geofencing, and full disk encryption. You
 can also enable geolocation-based authentication. This means that if 
you define a specific location, let’s say the user’s home address as the
 geolocation; the user authentication will fail if a user attempts 
authentication using the device from a different location.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-495"><b>Service Accounts </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-496">Service accounts are mainly used with applications 
and services. The users never use them. If you need to use an account 
for a database, you should use the service account, which has a static 
password that does not need to be changed. A service account never 
prompts for a password change. It may simply expire. For example, you 
are using a service account with an application programming interface 
(API). The password expires after 90 days. The API will stop functioning
 as the service account permissions are needed to fetch data from a 
remote server. In such a scenario, you should have a policy that should 
define the time duration when the service account password is due for a 
change. Even though you can set the service account password to never 
expire, it is not good security practice.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-497"><b>Administrator/Root Accounts</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-498">On a local system, a device, or a network, it is 
important to safeguard the administrator or the root access. You should 
never be using any user account with administrative privileges. In 
Windows, the Administrator is the default user with full privileges. In 
Linux and Unix environments, the root is the superuser with 
administrative privileges. If any of these accounts is compromised, 
depending on where it belongs, a local system or the network, you might 
put the environment at stake. If you need to use these accounts, ensure 
that you have multi-factor authentication enabled. You should also 
change the password regularly.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m31-501"><b>Exercise 8 - Organizational Policies</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m31-502">Each organization has assets, which could be 
hardware, software, and even employees. A certain set of organization 
policies define how the changes within the IT infrastructure should 
occur and the processes that drive the change. Making changes to the 
existing IT infrastructure can be dangerous. You would never know the 
outcome of a particular change that you are making. Therefore, certain 
methods and policies can be used to ensure that an organization's assets
 are safeguarded from any negative outcomes.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-503">In this exercise, you will learn about organizational policies.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m31-505">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-506">

<li id="cn-m31-506">Change Management</li>

<li id="cn-m31-507">Change Control</li>

<li id="cn-m31-508">Asset Management</li>

<p id="cn-m31-511"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m31-c-16" src="OrganizationalRiskManagementandPolicies_files/image-m31-c-16.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-512"><b>Change Management</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-513">IT teams across organizations can sometimes add or 
remove applications, systems, and servers without following the change 
management process. If things go wrong, then the recovery time is much 
higher than anticipated. In some cases, there is no fallback method to 
go back to the previous state before the change.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-514">The change management process allows you to implement
 changes within the IT environment systematically. When following a 
change management process, you know:</p>

<ul id="cn-m31-515">

<li id="cn-m31-515">What needs to be implemented</li>

<li id="cn-m31-516">Scope of the change being implemented</li>

<li id="cn-m31-517">What will be the impact of the change with new implementation as the change has already been tested thoroughly</li>

<li id="cn-m31-518">You know the process of implementation - installing an enterprise application or installing a new server</li>

<li id="cn-m31-519">You know the fallback process - if anything goes 
wrong during the change implementation, you can revert to the previous 
state. This is known as the fallback process.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m31-520">You document the change after it is successfully 
implemented. In a scenario where there is no change management process, 
you do not know the outcome of the change implementation. There are 
50-50 chances that it will fail or pass. You also do not have historical
 data about a similar change.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-521"><b>Change Control</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-522">Change control is the process of implementing a 
change. It monitors the entire process of change implementation. The 
change control process starts with scoping the change. You define a 
clear scope of the change that needs to be implemented. For example, you
 need to implement an update to the servers. You define the scope and 
include the servers as part of the scope. You then define the plan for 
rolling out the update. The plan should also include the rollback plan, 
which needs to be implemented if the change has a negative impact.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-524">After this, you need to test the update in a test 
environment. After the testing is successful, you need to get the change
 request approved by the change committee, which reviews your request 
with all the artifacts like the testing results. If the results are 
found satisfactory, then the change is approved. After the change is 
implemented, the change request is updated with the results. All the 
information about the change is documented.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m31-525"><b>Asset Management</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m31-526">An organization must track its assets, which are in 
the form of hardware, software, and data. With the implementation of 
asset management, you should track your tangible assets, such as 
software and hardware. There are applications available that can scan 
through the systems on the network and track the application licenses 
and collate their records in a single place. You can then verify if the 
systems are using legitimate applications or have exceeded the number of
 licenses.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-527">Similarly, you need to track your data and most 
importantly, you need to know who is using which pieces of data. You can
 implement Data Loss Prevention and monitor your data. It prevents 
unauthorized sharing of information.</p>

<p id="cn-m31-528">There are different types of asset management, such 
as digital asset management, IT asset management, and physical asset 
management.</p>

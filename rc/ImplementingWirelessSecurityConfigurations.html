<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m26-44"><b>Exercise 1 - Wireless Network and its Security</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m26-45">Wireless networks are everywhere now. The biggest 
advantage of a wireless network is that it allows user mobility, unlike 
an Ethernet network where the user is restricted due to an Ethernet 
cable being used. A wireless network allows the user to be mobile and 
connected within a certain range.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-46">802.11 is the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers) standard for wireless networking. 802.11b/g/n are
 common standards supported on wireless access points for home networks 
and for small offices. The 802.11 standard forms the underlying platform
 for all wireless networks, which have different capabilities. Most 
wireless routers support the following Wi-Fi standards:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-47"><b><i>802.11a</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-48">This runs at 54 Mbps and is not compatible with 
802.11b as it operates at the 5 GHz band. This standard was the first 
amendment of the original legacy IEEE 802.11 standard (1997) improving 
data rates from up to 2 Mbps of the original standard. It can cover an 
indoor area ranging from 35m to 125m.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-49"><b><i>802.11b</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-50">This provides a range of 150 feet and is the oldest 
standard still in use and supported by wireless routers. This is widely 
supported by wireless devices. IEEE 802.11b provides data rates of up to
 11 Mbps using the 2.4 GHz band.  This standard provides lower maximum 
data rates, but a greater range than the 802.11a standard since the 2.4 
GHz frequencies used are not as readily absorbed by walls and obstacles 
as the 5 GHz frequencies used in 802.11a are.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-51"><b><i>802.11g</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-52">This is supported by all wireless devices and network 
equipment today and is an economical option for buying a wireless access
 point. 802.11g is the same speed as 802.11a, however, it has a longer 
range of 170 feet and supports the 2.4 GHz frequency band. IEEE 802.11g 
provides data rates of up to 54 Mbps. This functions in the 2.4 GHz band
 (like 802.11b) but uses the same Orthogonal Frequency-Division 
Multiplexing (OFDM)-based transmission scheme as 802.11a. Since the 
wireless keyboard also operates at 2.4 GHz band, it is likely to cause 
interference with the 802.11b network.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-53"><b><i>802.11n</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-54">This is faster than 802.11g and supported by network 
devices. 802.11n has a network speed of 600 Mbps and a maximum range of 
230 feet. This standard uses multiple input/multiple output (MIMO) and 
may cause interference with nearby 802.11b/g networks. 802.11n has a 
higher price point than 802.11g.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-55"><b><i>802.11ac</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-56">This offers a speed of 1.33 Gigabits and a similar 
range to 802.11n (230 feet). IEEE 802.11ac is an amendment that improves
 upon the previous IEEE 802.11 standards. Characteristics of this 
standard include the introduction of wider channels (80 or 160 MHz 
compared to 40 MHz for 802.11n) in the 5 GHz band, more spatial streams 
(up to 8), and the addition of Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO). 802.11ac is 
capable of transmitting data at 1300 Mbps (megabits per second) or 162.5
 Mbps (megabytes per second).</p>

<p id="cn-m26-57">Despite the speed and range of different wireless 
standards, they need to be used correctly. For example, if the wireless 
router or access points are not hardened, then no standard is safe for 
use.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-58">In this exercise, you will learn about wireless networks and their security.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m26-68"><b>Cryptographic Protocols</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m26-69">A wireless network can use different cryptographic 
protocols, which have evolved over the years. Even though, at one time, 
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) were 
popular protocols and were widely used. However, WEP and WPA are no 
longer supported by the wireless access points. WPA2 is the default 
cryptography protocol that is supported by all wireless access points.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-70">In this task, you will learn about the cryptographic protocols in a wireless network.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-71"><b><i>Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-72">WPA is no longer considered a secure solution and has 
been replaced by WPA2, also known as 802.11i, which is currently 
mandatory on all Wi-Fi devices and provides CCMP and AES encryption 
support. WPA2-AES is the standard for newer wireless routers where all 
clients support AES. The WPA and WPA2 standards have adopted EAP with a 
myriad of EAP types as official authentication mechanisms. One of these 
is the EAP Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) that uses the Transport 
Layer Security (TLS) protocol and is well-supported among wireless 
vendors.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-73">WPA2 can be implemented in two different modes:</p>

<ul id="cn-m26-74">

<li id="cn-m26-74"><b>Preshared key</b>: A shared secret is used to authenticate the client.</li>

<li id="cn-m26-75"><b>Authentication server</b>: An authentication server is used to authenticate the client.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m26-76"><b>Encryption Algorithm: </b>AES, CCMP</p>

<p id="cn-m26-77"><b>IV Size: </b>48-bits</p>

<p id="cn-m26-78"><b>Encryption Key: </b>128-Bits</p>

<p id="cn-m26-79"><b>Integrity Check Method: </b>CBC-MAC</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-80"><b><i>WiFi Protected Access III (WPA3)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-81">WPA3 is the successor of WPA2. It adds several new capabilities that did not exist in WPA2. It adds some capabilities, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m26-82">

<li id="cn-m26-82">Protection from several attacks, such as 
de-authentication, handshake capture dictionary, PMKID Hash Dictionary, 
KRACK exploit, and handshake capture encrypt/decrypt.</li>

<li id="cn-m26-83">Uses Wi-Fi Easy Connect instead of Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). Wi-Fi Easy Connect uses Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP).</li>

<li id="cn-m26-84">Replaces Pre-Shared Key (PSK) with Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)</li>

<li id="cn-m26-85">Supports Protected Management Frames (PMF)</li>

<li id="cn-m26-86">Blocks authentication after certain number of failed attempts</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m26-87"><b>Encryption Algorithm: </b>AES-GCM &amp; Elliptical Curve Cryptography of CNSA Suite B</p>

<p id="cn-m26-88"><b>Encryption Key: </b>192-Bits for Enterprise, 128-bit for Personal</p>

<p id="cn-m26-89"><b>Integrity Check Method: </b>Secure Hash Algorithm</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-90"><b><i>Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol) (CCMP)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-91">CCMP is an AES encryption-based protocol that is used 
in the 802.11i network. It is mainly designed to provide 
confidentiality, data origin authentication, and integrity that needs to
 be transmitted from one endpoint to another endpoint. However, it is 
important to note that CCMP does not provide fault tolerance and 
reliability.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-92">It uses different elements for the data security. For 
example, Counter CTR mode ciphers, which is a block cipher, secures the 
data during transmission. It uses CBC-MAC to prevent data modification 
during its transmission.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-93"><b><i>Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-94">In a typical wireless network, if it does not have 
enterprise mode enabled, you need to provide a password to connect to 
it. Simultaneous Authentication of Equals or SAE adds another element in
 the authentication process. Along with the password, it also enforces 
the MAC address authentication.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-95">At the base of it, SAE uses Diffie-Hellman key 
exchange method. However, it adds an additional authentication 
requirement, which is authenticating the MAC address as well. The SAE 
process starts with the SAE exchange after which the client and the 
wireless access point (WAP), both create an encryption key that is 
further used to create a session key. After the session key is 
generated, the client is able to connect to the WAP.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-96">The key advantage of SAE is that each time the session
 key is uniquely generated. If one key is compromised, the other 
sessions are not impacted.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m26-97"><b>Authentication Protocols</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m26-98">There are several different types of authentication 
protocols. However, it is only your requirement that will help you 
decide which type of protocol to use. For example, you may want a 
certificate-based protocol to be used. If you do not have a certificate 
authority (CA), then you can choose a protocol that does not require 
certificate-based authentication.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-99">Let’s look at some of the key authentication protocols.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-100"><b><i>IEEE 802.1X</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-101">IEEE 802.1X uses port-based network access control. 
When a device attempts to connect to the network, it authenticates the 
device and then opens a virtual port on the wireless access point. 
However, if authentication fails, then the device is not allowed to 
access the network. Essentially, there are three components that play a 
critical role:</p>

<ul id="cn-m26-102">

<li id="cn-m26-102"><b>Suppliant</b>: It is the device that has to connect to the network. It would usually have a software that is used for connectivity</li>

<li id="cn-m26-103"><b>Authenticator</b>: it is the wireless access point in the case of the wireless network. It could also be a firewall or a proxy server.</li>

<li id="cn-m26-104"><b>Authentication Server</b>: it is the authentication server that grants or denies access. Typically, this role is played by a RADIUS server.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m26-105">When a suppliant attempts to connect to the network, 
the authenticator immediately sets the ports to which they are connected
 to the unauthenticated state. The authenticator sends a set of frames 
requesting for authentication credentials. The suppliant then provides 
authentication credentials. After receiving the credentials, the 
authenticator sends them to the authentication server, which then 
verifies and informs the authenticator. After receiving the response 
from the authentication server, if credentials are accepted, the 
authenticator sets the port status to authenticated. After the device 
disconnects from the network, the authenticator changes the port status 
is changed to unauthenticated.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-106"><b><i>Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-107">IEEE 802.1x uses EAP for sharing the authentication 
information between the supplicant and the authentication server, such 
as a RADIUS server. The EAP protocol is the actual carrier for the 
authentication information and is used with variety of wireless 
protocols, such as WPA and WPA2.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-108">There are different variants of EAP. Some of them use
 certificates while others do not. One of the drawbacks of EAP is that 
it, by default, does not secure the authentication information. It takes
 it for granted that the information that it is carrying is secured or 
encrypted.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-109"><b><i>Protected Extensible Application Protocol (PEAP)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-110">Protected Extensible Application Protocol or PEAP was
 an improvement over EAP. Because EAP does not encrypt the information 
that it carries. PEAP made an improvement over this drawback and 
corrected it by using a secure Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnel.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-111">PEAP uses a TLS tunnel to transport information from 
one end to the other end, which are essentially the suppliant and the 
authenticator. The information is encrypted and authenticated by a 
server-side certificate to ensure it cannot be tampered with. TLS is the
 security protocol used by PEAP.  TLS is used to add encryption and 
authentication to the protocols.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-112">PEAP is mainly used with 802.1X wireless access 
points and switches. It is also used by Windows-based VPN and Terminal 
Services Gateway.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-113"><b><i>EAP Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP FAST)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-114">Unlike PEAP, EAP-FAST does not use a certificate for 
authentication. It rather uses Protected Access Credential (PAC). Like 
EAP, EAP-FAST also has three components, suppliant, authenticator, and 
the authentication server, which manages the PAC. The authentication 
server is responsible for distributing PAC to the suppliant, which is 
the client. The PAC can either be distributed manually or automatically.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-115">The authentication server provides a shared secret to
 the suppliant. After this, a secured tunnel is established between both
 the ends, the authentication server and the client. Finally, the 
suppliant is authenticated.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-116"><b><i>EAP Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-117">EAP Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) makes use of 
the TLS protocol. EAP-TLS requires two certificates, one at the client 
end and another one at the server end. The authentication is performed 
based on the certificate rather than the user credentials. Even if 
someone intercepts the user credentials, they will still not be able to 
connect to the wireless network. This is because the certificate is 
required for authentication.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-118"><b><i>EAP Tunneled Transport Layer Security (EAP TTLS)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-119">EAP TLS required certificates for authentication. 
This can be a big drawback in an enterprise environment where there are 
thousands of devices connecting to a wireless network. EAP TTLS removes 
this bottleneck by using a secure tunnel between the authentication 
server and the suppliant. It does not require a certificate like EAP TLS
 does.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-120">After a secure tunnel is created, the suppliant can 
use the user credentials to authenticate itself with the authentication 
server. Because the tunnel is secured, it prevents any type of attack, 
such as eavesdropping, to take place for intercepting the user 
credentials.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-121"><b><i>Remote Authentication Dial-in User Server (RADIUS) Federation</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-122">Network administrators deploy remote access servers 
(RAS) that give mobile users the capability to dial-up and connect to 
corporate resources like folders, files and applications. For 
scalability, network managers add more RAS servers and deploy a modem 
pool to accommodate more dial-in users. However, this infrastructure 
upgrade will require more resource to be spent for the hardware, long 
distance call charges and toll-free telephone service. A company may opt
 to outsource their remote access services to a third party to save on 
telephone charges but there is a security risk of entrusting and 
managing your dial-up user accounts to an external organization, 
typically Internet Service Providers (ISPs).</p>

<p id="cn-m26-123">Fortunately, the problem of managing user accounts 
and security can be addressed with the use of virtual private networks 
and Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS). Virtual private
 networks (VPNs) make use of an existing Internet connection to connect 
to corporate network resources. Therefore, a user can be located 
anywhere in the world and be able to gain access to network resources by
 using the Internet and then connecting to the VPN server. While RADIUS 
provides a centralized infrastructure for authentication of dial-in VPN 
users, authorization for access of network resources and count the 
number of minutes a dial-in user spends in a remote session.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-124">The following statements are true for RADIUS:</p>

<ul id="cn-m26-125">

<li id="cn-m26-125">There is a common authentication system and credentials database.</li>

<li id="cn-m26-126">Each member retains its own administrative control.</li>

<li id="cn-m26-127">Members of the federation share the same level of trust.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m26-128"><b>Methods</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m26-129">There are several methods to connect to a wireless 
network. It is quite a possibility that the wireless network does not 
require a password. However, in most cases, a password is required, it 
all depends on the configuration of the wireless network. In an office 
environment that is running a directory service, such as Active 
Directory, the administrator may simply integrate authentication so that
 the users are authenticated based on their accounts. In such a case, 
the user does not have to provide the user credentials for accessing the
 wireless network.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-130">In this task, you will learn about different methods of accessing a wireless network.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-131"><b><i>Pre-shared key (PSK) vs. Enterprise vs. Open</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-132">A wireless network can be configured in different 
modes, which are PSK, enterprise, or open. In the enterprise mode, a 
RADIUS server is used for authenticating the user. In this mode of 
implementation, encrypted session keys are sent to the client from the 
RADIUS server. To make it more secure, certificates can be integrated 
with the private/public key pair. When a user attempts to connect to the
 wireless network, the user is authenticated based on his own user 
credentials, which can be stored in Active Directory.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-133">In the pre-shared mode, the client and the wireless 
access point must exchange and negotiate a key before the communication 
can begin. It does not utilize the RADIUS server as the communication is
 directly between the client and the wireless access point. In the open 
mode, there is no authentication and is unsecured. It is usually used in
 public wireless access points where there is no access to the sensitive
 data.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-134">In the open mode, there is no authentication 
performed when a user attempts to connect to the wireless network. User 
simply selects the network and connects to it without providing a 
password.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-135"><b><i>WiFi Protected Setup (WPS)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-136">In a typical wireless network scenario, you have to 
first know the SSID or select the correct SSID from the wireless network
 list and then provide a password to connect to it. Without knowing the 
password, you cannot connect to the wireless network. WPS works in a 
different manner. You need to have a wireless router that supports WPS. 
It is a button that is given near the Ethernet ports in back of the 
router.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-137">First, you have to press the WPS button, which 
enables the wireless devices discovery. From the device, such as a 
mobile phone or printer, you have to select the SSID of the wireless 
network, after which device can automatically connect to it. There is no
 need to provide a password.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-138">In another scenario, the wireless router, when you 
enable WPS, sends a password to the device. Once the device receives the
 password, it can connect to the wireless router. You do not have to 
press the WPS button again.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-139">In another method, you can also enable an 8-digit 
PIN, which is generated by the wireless router automatically. When a 
device attempts to connect to the wireless network, it is prompted to 
provide the 8-digit PIN.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-140"><b><i>Captive Portals</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-141">You may have visited to a hotel or the airport lounge
 where you get free wireless connectivity. However, these wireless 
networks are not open, which means they are secured by taking a password
 as an input. However, the process of captive portal differs. When you 
connect to a captive portal, you are prompted to accept the Acceptable 
Usage Policy (AUP) document, which is to ensure that you do not misuse 
the Internet connectivity for illegal activities. After a user accepts 
the policy, he is allowed to access the wireless network.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-142">A captive portal may also prompt for the mobile 
number on which the user credentials are sent. Once the credentials are 
fed into the captive portal, the user is allowed to access the Internet.
 However, the user still has to accept the AUP.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m26-143"><b>Installation Considerations</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m26-144">Before you install and configure a wireless network, 
there are several points that you must consider. For example, the 
wireless network installation is effective when there is least 
interference, which can be possibly detected by reviewing the floor 
plan. You may also consider the number of WAP that you must install. In 
this task, you will look at several such considerations.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-145"><b><i>Site Surveys</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-146">Conducting a site survey is typically the first step 
in implementing a wireless network. A site survey helps to determine 
where to place Wi-Fi access points for the maximum coverage while 
minimizing the number of access points needed for that coverage.  It 
also reveals the location of signal interference from other Radio 
Frequency (RF) sources as well as interference caused by physical 
obstacles.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-147">With the help of site survey you need to figure out 
the suitability of installing WAPs. With the layout of the building, you
 would be able to determine the number of WAPs required. You would also 
be able to determine the type of antennas that may be suitable. For 
example, should you use the unidirectional antennas if the signals have 
to be sent to a single direction. If the building has several rooms, 
then this point becomes critical in deciding the number of WAPs that are
 required.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-148">Another point that you need to explore in site survey
 is the number of users who would be connecting to the wireless network.
 If it is a large room with a big crowd, then you may need more than one
 WAP to handle to load. Other point that you need to explore is the type
 of ceiling because this would help you determine the mounting hardware 
for the WAPs.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-149">Manual site survey can help you determine several of 
these factors. However, you can explore the possibility of using 
software like Survey Pro that can help you decide the location of the 
WAPs.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-150"><b><i>Heat Maps</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-151">When you install a WAP, you may want to verify the 
coverage of the wireless network. In a building, there can be a 
possibility that several areas, whether they are far away or have 
interfering objects, such as walls, do not receive signals. Without 
using a heat map, it is not possible to find the areas that have either 
good or bad coverage. For examples, wireless network signals are often 
blocked by walls, ceilings, wireless radios, or even other wireless 
networks. You can use software to generate a heat map to detect the 
signal strengths.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-152">You can explore dead zones, which do not receive any 
wireless signals. If there are such areas, then you may either move the 
WAP to another location or install a wireless network range extender, 
which can be located near the dead zones. It will catch the WAP signals 
and further broadcast them, which increases the wireless network range.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-153"><b><i>WiFi Analyzers</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-154">Just like an Ethernet or wired network, you also need
 to analyze the wireless network on regular basis. You may have the 
wireless network installed and configured, but you cannot be sure 
whether it is providing the best performance. With a Wi-Fi analyzer, you
 can analyze its performance and review several parameters, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m26-155">

<li id="cn-m26-155">SSID</li>

<li id="cn-m26-156">Signal strength</li>

<li id="cn-m26-157">Minimum, maximum, and average signal strength</li>

<li id="cn-m26-158">Channel and band being used</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m26-159"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m26-c-2" src="ImplementingWirelessSecurityConfigurations_files/image-m26-c-2.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1 Screenshot of NetSpot"><figcaption>Figure 1.1 Screenshot of NetSpot: Showing the status of various wireless networks.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m26-160">With the help of a Wi-Fi analyzer, it is possible to 
improve performance. For example, there may be interference of several 
objects within the building, and therefore, you observe weak signals in 
the Wi-Fi analyzer, which can reveal several factors such as other 
wireless networks using the same band. There can be a possibility of 
interference from other wireless networks in that case.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-161">You can also review an individual wireless network 
and review signal strength. If you find that the signal strength is not 
optimum, you know something is wrong, which needs to be corrected.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-162"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m26-c-3" src="ImplementingWirelessSecurityConfigurations_files/image-m26-c-3.jpg" alt="Figure 1.2 Screenshot of NetSpot"><figcaption>Figure 1.2 Screenshot of NetSpot: Showing the signal strength of a single wireless network.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-163"><b><i>Channel Overlays</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-164">Different wireless networks have different speeds. 
However, most commonly 2.4 GHz radio band is used in wireless networks. 
The 2.4 GHz is divided into 11 channels. Most channels overlay or 
overlap with others, but channels 1, 6, and 11 do not overlay or overlap
 with the other channels.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-165"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m26-c-4" src="ImplementingWirelessSecurityConfigurations_files/image-m26-c-4.jpg" alt="Figure 1.3 Screenshot of wireless network channels"><figcaption>Figure 1.3 Screenshot of wireless network channels: Showing the overlapping of wireless channels.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m26-166">In most probability, channel 11 is used by the more 
WAPs. However, if nearby WAPs are using the same channel, then there can
 be performance issues. A good metaphor would be that everyone is 
talking simultaneously, and therefore, no one can understand what 
another person is saying. If there are such experiences, you can change 
the channel to communicate.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-167"><b><i>Wireless Access Point (WAP) Placement</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-168">Several factors are involved in WAP placement. Before
 making a placement, you should determine the best location through a 
survey. If that is not done for some reason, you should place it in a 
location or room where the users are present. You have to remember that 
putting it in a common area, such as a lobby, is not the best placement.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-169">When designing a wireless network, it is important to
 choose the correct antenna type. An omnidirectional antenna is one that
 radiates radio wave power uniformly in all directions in one plane. 
Physically, they usually resemble an upright pole or rod.  A directional
 antenna radiates greater radio wave power in specific directions 
allowing for increased performance and reduced interference in those 
areas.  Depending on the need, you need to carefully select that WAP 
that has an appropriate antenna type.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-170">When placing a WAP, you need to be aware of the interferences from the different object, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m26-171">

<li id="cn-m26-171">Electronic devices, such as cordless phones</li>

<li id="cn-m26-172">Walls, doors, and ceilings</li>

<li id="cn-m26-173">Nearby wireless networks</li>

<li id="cn-m26-174">Number of users</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m26-175">If these points are not considered, then you play the WAP in an inappropriate location.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m26-176"><b><i>Controller and Access Point Security</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m26-177">You would typically see one WAP that handles the 
wireless network traffic in a home or small office environment. However,
 in a large network, there may be hundreds of WAPs that are installed. A
 WAP is the point to which the users connect. It is not administratively
 possible for these WAPs to be individually managed. Therefore, you use a
 wireless controller, which provides a centralized platform to manage 
all the available WAPs. You can monitor the WAPs in real-time.</p>

<p id="cn-m26-178">It is critical to ensure security for WAP and the 
controller. Several steps must be performed to secure both the 
controller and the WAPs. Some of the key steps that you should perform 
are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m26-179">

<li id="cn-m26-179">Change the default admin passwords</li>

<li id="cn-m26-180">Restrict logical and physical access</li>

<li id="cn-m26-181">Enable encryption</li>

<li id="cn-m26-182">Hide the SSIDs</li>

<li id="cn-m26-183">Update the controller and WAPs with software patches</li>

<li id="cn-m26-184">Enable MAC filtering</li>

<li id="cn-m26-185">Enable authentication</li>

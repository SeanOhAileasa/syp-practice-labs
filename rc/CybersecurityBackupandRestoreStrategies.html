<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m16-76"><b>Exercise 1 - Redundancy</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m16-77">In simple terms, redundancy is a method of duplicating
 a piece of data or server or any component to ensure that the 
duplicated one is available to serve the purpose if the primary one 
fails. For example, you make a redundant copy of the data folder in 
online storage, which synchronizes from the source folder in real-time. 
If the source folder is deleted or the system crashes, you can recover 
the entire folder on another system from the online storage. You always 
implement redundancy to avoid a single point of failure.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-78">In this exercise, you will learn about redundancy and its related terms.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m16-80">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m16-81">

<li id="cn-m16-81">Redundancy</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m16-83">This exercise contains supporting materials for Security+.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-84"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m16-c-1" src="CybersecurityBackupandRestoreStrategies_files/image-m16-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m16-85"><b>Redundancy </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m16-86">Redundancy can be added at multiple levels, not just 
the data. For example, within a server, you can have two hard drives 
where the files and folders of one hard drive are mirrored to the other.
 The contents of the second hard drive are overwritten. You can add 
redundant network interface cards (NICs) or power supplies. You can 
configure redundant servers in a failover cluster and you can even put 
up a redundant site, which can be a hot, cold or warm site.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-87"><b><i>Geographic Dispersal</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-88">With the invention of cloud computing, it is easy to 
geographically disperse your data. You can keep one copy on your system,
 and another copy can be replicated to the cloud, which in turn, will 
have replicated that copy of the data for redundancy. When you save a 
piece of data to the cloud, it is automatically replicated to different 
geographical locations to ensure that if there is an incident with one 
geographical location, let’s say floods; the data is still intact in 
another geographical location.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-89">An alternate method to cloud is to put up your servers
 in different geographical locations and replicate data. However, it is a
 costly affair, but the choice of which method to use remains with the 
organization. For example, a financial institution will spend the money 
to put up their servers to ensure data privacy and confidentiality. It 
would not replicate their data to the cloud.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-90"><b><i>Disk</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-91">Each server within an organization would hold some 
kind of data or another. To be able to safeguard the data, you need to 
ensure that there is some level of redundancy build. You can implement a
 Redundant Array of Independent Drives (RAID) to enable redundancy with 
the hard disks. You must use an operating system that can carry out a 
RAID and choose either software or hardware RAID to implement. In order 
to implement a hardware RAID, you need a RAID controller. An example of 
an operating system that provides the capabilities to carry out a RAID 
is Windows Server 2019.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-92">There are different levels of RAID that can be 
enforced. Before executing a specific RAID level, you need to ensure 
that it meets the business’s objective. For example, if you need fault 
tolerance, then RAID 0 should not be implemented. Let’s look at the RAID
 levels for better comprehension.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-93"><b>RAID 0</b>: Known as disk striping. It requires two
 disks. The data is written in stripes on each of the disks. RAID 0 is 
mostly used when you need high performance when dealing with heavy read 
operations. However, it is important to note that if one of the two 
disks fails, the data is lost.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-94"><b>RAID 1</b>: Known as disk mirroring. It also 
requires two disks. One disk is mirrored to another disk, and you only 
get one disk's capacity as the other disk is redundant. It provides high
 read performance. However, RAID 1 should not be used when you need high
 write performance.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-95"><b>RAID 5</b>: Known as disk striping with parity. To 
build RAID 5, you need to have at least three disks. It provides high 
read performance. However, RAID 5 should not be used when you need high 
write performance. You also lose 1/3 of the disk storage in total as it 
is used for parity, which is the extra information stored for recovering
 a failed disk in RAID. For example, if each hard disk is 100 GB. Then, 
instead of getting 300 GB, you only get 200 GB. The 100 GB is used for 
parity.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-96"><b>RAID 6</b>: Known as disk striping with double 
parity. It works similarly to RAID 5. However, instead of three hard 
disks, it requires a minimum of four hard disks. It can continue to work
 even if two hard disks fail. Even though it is good for excellent read 
operations, it should not be used when there are heavy write operations.
 It works slower than RAID 5 because RIAD 6 has to write another block 
of parity information.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-97"><b>RAID 10</b>: Known as disk striping, mirroring, and
 RAID 1+0. It requires a minimum of four hard disks. When you are 
looking for excellent write performance and fault tolerance, RAID 10 is 
the one you should implement. For example, RAID 10 is a perfect fit for 
database servers that have high write operations. One of the drawbacks 
is that you lose half of the total disk space. For example, if there are
 four disks, and each disk is 100 GB, you would lose 200 GB because this
 is mirrored to the remaining 200 GB.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-98"><b><i>Multipathing</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-99">Other than RAID, you can also use multipathing. With 
the implementation of multipathing, you need to create several paths 
from a system to the storage where you need to replicate the data. In 
the server, you would need several NICs so that the data can go out of 
the server through them. You would also need to ensure that several 
paths are available for the data to reach its storage on the network. 
You need redundant switches, cables, routers, and ports to implement 
multipathing.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-100"><b><i>Network</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-101">There are different methods to build network 
redundancy. To start with, you can have redundant NICs or network 
interface adapters in a server. If one NIC fails, then the redundant one
 can continue to function. You can also have redundant routers, 
switches, and even firewalls on the network.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-102">You can also have load balancers that help you to 
distribute loads to the servers. This helps the servers to provide 
optimum performance as one server is not overloaded. The load balancers,
 which are configured on the network, become the front-end for the 
servers and pass on the requests to the servers depending on the 
configuration.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-103"><b><i>Power</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-104">Power is the most critical requirement when you need 
to ensure your data center works. Without power, you cannot run any 
network device or even servers. Therefore, other than the main power, 
you also need to have redundant power, which can be achieved by having 
redundant power supplies within the servers and other network devices.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-105">The redundant power supplies should be connected with
 an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), which continues to provide power
 to the server or device in the event that the main power fails. A UPS 
can either be online or offline. The offline UPS activates when there is
 no main power supply. The online UPS continues to run along with the 
main power supply.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-106">In some cases, the generators can also be used. 
Several large organizations run silent generators that power on as and 
when the main power supply is interrupted.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-107">Other than the generators, the managed power 
distribution units (PDUs) are commonly used in data centers. They are 
meant to take three or more phase inputs and then distribute the power 
through the one-phase output. They are designed to distribute power to 
the rack-mounted servers and network devices.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m16-110"><b>Exercise 2 - Replication </b></h2>

<p id="cn-m16-111">Replication is a method of creating a replica or copy
 of original data. This can be done on the same server, another server 
in the same premises, or even another server in a different location. 
Replication is not only done between servers, it can also be done 
between a server and storage solutions, such as Network Attached Storage
 (NAS) or Storage Area Network (SAN). Several other methods can be used 
for replication.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-112">Replication can be synchronous or asynchronous. When 
referring to synchronous replication, it creates a copy or replica of 
data in real-time. When referring to asynchronous replication, it is 
triggered only at a defined schedule.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-113">In replication, you are essentially creating a copy 
of the data to ensure that you can retrieve the replicated copy if the 
source data is lost or corrupt. In this exercise, you will learn about 
replication on SAN and virtual machines (VMs).</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m16-115">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m16-116">

<li id="cn-m16-116">Storage Area Network (SAN)</li>

<li id="cn-m16-117">Virtual Machines (VMs)</li>

<h3 id="cn-m16-122"><b>Storage Area Network (SAN) </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m16-123">SAN is one of the primary methods of data backup. 
However, with SANs, it is easier to perform replication from one 
location to another location, which can be offsite. The replication is 
extremely fast as compared to other backup and replication methods.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-124">You can either perform the SAN-to-SAN replication. 
This method quickly pushes a large amount of data as a replica on the 
secondary SAN, which can be deployed on an offsite location. On the 
other hand, you can use SAN snapshots, which replicates only the 
point-in-time data to another SAN, otherwise known as asynchronous 
replication.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m16-125"><b>Virtual Machines (VMs)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m16-126">Virtual machines or VMs work just like any normal 
system or server, with the exception that they do not have any hardware.
 They run on a server and use its virtual hardware to run. Virtual 
machines running business-critical applications or hosting critical data
 also need to be safeguarded from failures. Replication is the method 
that can be used to ensure if the running VM fails, the replicated VM 
can be restored and back online in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-127">VM replication can be of two types. The first type is
 real-time replication. When the data is being written to the VM, the 
entire VM is being replicated to another location or server. This type 
of replication provides the exact copy of the VM. The second type is the
 point-in-time replication, which is scheduled at a specific time. This 
type of replication only provides the replica, if required to restore, 
from the time when it was replicated.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m16-128"><b>On-premises vs. Cloud</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m16-129">Data replication can either be done on-premise or in 
the cloud. For example, you can replicate all your data to SAN, which is
 located on-premise. The SAN can then replicate the information to 
another SAN, which is located in another premise or location.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-130">The data can also be replicated to the cloud. 
Microsoft OneDrive or DropBox are two examples that can use their 
desktop utilities to replicate the data to the cloud. The benefit is 
that the data is always available. It can be accessed from anywhere and 
at any given point in time. This is not an advantage with the on-premise
 replication, as you may have to be physically available to retrieve the
 replicated data.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m16-133"><b>Exercise 3 - Backup Types</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m16-134">There are different types of backups that you can 
perform. You can back up data on the same local system, an external 
drive, another networked server, or even the cloud. Each backup type has
 its pros and cons. For example, for cloud backup, you need an Internet 
connection. However, the biggest advantage is that you can connect from 
anywhere globally and retrieve data or synchronize new files with the 
existing backup as long as you have an Internet connection.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-135">In this exercise, you will learn to use Microsoft 
OneDrive for backing up files in the cloud. You will also learn to 
establish an automated backup.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m16-147"><b>Types of Data Backup </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m16-148">To prevent data loss, you can back up your data. 
Backing up data means that you are making a redundant copy of the data. 
It could be on a DVD, USB drive, or a cloud drive.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-149">For example, you may suffer data loss by accidentally
 deleting files. However, if you have the latest copy backed up on a 
cloud drive, you could restore the files.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-150">When you backup your important data on a USB drive, 
DVD, network location, or in a cloud drive, you need to ensure that you 
do not end up backing up each file on your system. This is because you 
would exhaust the space on the backup drive. You should backup only the 
files that are important and of use to you. For example, you would 
probably not want to backup an application installer that is readily 
available on the Internet.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-151">There are a few types of data backup:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-152"><b><i>Full backup </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-153">As the name indicates, a full backup backs up all the
 files or folders you selected. You can also create a full backup of an 
entire drive. A full backup takes a longer time to complete as each file
 and folder is backed up. It is also important to note that a full 
backup is faster to restore as you are restoring from a single copy of 
the backup.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-154">Summary of features of a full backup:</p>

<ul id="cn-m16-155">

<li id="cn-m16-155"><b>Data backup: </b>Complete or all data</li>

<li id="cn-m16-156"><b>Backup speed: </b>Slowest</li>

<li id="cn-m16-157"><b>Restore speed: </b>Fast</li>

<li id="cn-m16-158"><b>Storage space: </b>High</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m16-159"><b><i>Incremental backup </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-160">An incremental backup is done after a full backup has
 been taken. It backs up the files and folders that are either new or 
modified since the last backup, which could be any type of backup. For 
example, let’s assume that you have taken a full backup on Monday. On 
Tuesday, you run the incremental backup. It will only backup files that 
have changed since Monday. If you run another incremental backup on 
Wednesday, it will backup only the files that have changed since 
Tuesday.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-161">Summary of features of an incremental backup:</p>

<ul id="cn-m16-162">

<li id="cn-m16-162"><b>Data backup: </b>Only new or modified files and folders</li>

have taken a full backup on Monday. On Tuesday, you run the differential
 backup. It will only backup files that have been changed or created 
since Monday. If you run another differential backup on Wednesday, it 
will backup all files that have changed or created since Monday.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m16-173"><b>Task 2 - Use Cloud Storage for Backup</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m16-174">Microsoft OneDrive is a built-in utility in Windows 
10. If you have a Hotmail or Outlook account, you can use this utility 
to back up your data in the OneDrive storage. When you use this utility,
 you can configure it to keep a copy of the data on your local system 
and also one copy on OneDrive. As you make changes to the local data, 
the changes are replicated to OneDrive instantly if your Internet 
connection is on.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m16-643"><b>Backup Methods</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m16-644">Depending on your requirements, you can use different
 backup methods. For example, a full backup is not really useful in the 
case of a virtual machine. You would need to backup the entire virtual 
machine and it would take a large amount of disk space. With the files 
and folders, a backup method, such as full backup, works well as these 
files can change or are created on daily basis.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-645">In this task, you will learn about different types of backup methods.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-646"><b><i>Snapshot</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-647">A snapshot is the saved state of a current virtual machine state, including any applied settings or configurations.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-648">Assume that you are working with a virtual machine 
and need to make some configuration changes. However, you do not know 
the impact of the configuration changes. Therefore, you want to ensure 
that you can revert to the previous state if any issue occurs. To do 
this, you can take a snapshot of the current virtual machine state.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-649">It is important to note that all virtual machine 
applications, such as VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, and VMware 
vSphere, allow you to take snapshots. These applications also allow you 
to create several snapshots, and each snapshot can have a different 
saved state of the virtual machine.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-650"><b><i>Tape</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-651">Tapes are an older backup method. Even though disk 
and cloud backups are now more popular, tape backups are still used in 
many organizations. One of the key benefits of using a tape backup is 
that it can be stored for several years. You also have tape drives that 
can mount several tapes at once, and therefore, the backups can be 
automated across multiple tapes at once.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-652">The tapes use sequential access, which means that you
 have to get to the point in the tape where the data is stored. With the
 long shelf life, the tapes are mainly used with data that needs to be 
archived and rarely accessed. For example, an insurance firm needs to 
store data for seven years. They can archive the data in tape backups 
and keep them in a safe location. As and when required, the data can be 
retrieved.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-653"><b><i>Disk</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-654">Disk backups have taken over the tapes backups. 
Organizations have started using disks for taking backups because it is 
fast and allows direct access. Unlike tapes, which offer sequential 
access, the disks have direct access. This means that you can connect 
the disk and directly get to the folders or directories you want to 
retrieve. Unlike tapes, the data backup in disks may take longer, but 
retrieval is much faster.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-655"><b><i>Copy</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-656">A copy backup is simply a copy of the original data. 
You select a set of folders or directories, copy them, and paste them at
 another location or server. This way, you have made a copy of the 
source folders or directories. However, the copy version cannot update 
itself from the original folders and directories. Once you have made a 
copy, then you need to update it manually.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-657"><b><i>Network Attached Storage (NAS)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-658">A NAS server is mainly used for file storage 
purposes. When you have several servers in an organization, they can 
store data on their hard drives or store data on a NAS server. For 
example, if a server stores the data in itself, then the data is only 
available when the server is online. With NAS, the data is still 
available even if the server is not online.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-659">NAS uses the storage-centric design, in which the 
data is centrally located. This takes off the burden from the servers to
 process data as and when required. NAS takes the load of handling the 
data processing activities.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-660"><b><i>Online vs. Offline</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-661">Backups can be online or offline. Depending on your 
organization's infrastructure, you may be able to use either of the 
backup types or possibly both at the same time.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-662">An online backup makes a copy of the source data to 
another server in a remote location. An organization could set up its 
remote servers to make online backups.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-663">Another method of online backups is cloud backups. 
There are several Cloud Service Providers (CSP) who allow you to make 
backups. Some of them also offer free space, but a larger amount of 
space may need to be purchased with a subscription. For example, 
Microsoft OneDrive.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-664">There are several advantages of online backups. Your 
data in the cloud is usually encrypted and replicated across different 
locations. Therefore, there is no fear of losing data even in case of an
 incident, such as a hurricane or flood. Another advantage of online 
data is that you can have access to your data at any time.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-665">However, there are also some disadvantages to online 
backups. To perform and access backups, you need to have an Internet 
connection. Depending upon the speed of the Internet connection, you may
 face challenges of slow access to data. Also, with cloud backups, you 
do not have direct control of where your data is residing.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-666">Offline backups are performed on tapes, Blu-ray, DVDs, and hard drives, either internal or external.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-667">A main advantage of an offline backup is that it is 
fast and is in your direct control. Also, since the backup media is 
portable, they can be moved from one location to another location. When 
dealing with large volumes of backups, it is best to do it on an 
external hard drive or tape media as they would not fit on the USB drive
 or DVDs. External hard drives or tape media have a larger capacity.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-668">The disadvantages of offline backups are that they 
can be stolen, destroyed, or can simply fail. For example, a hard drive 
containing a backup could fail. If the offline backup is kept in a 
remote location, it may take a long time to get the backup media before 
performing the restoration.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-669"><b><i>Offsite Storage</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-670">Most organizations perform backups. However, it is 
critical to follow the 3-2-1 rule when it comes to backups. With the 
3-2-1 rule implemented, three backup copies are created. Out of the 
three copies, two copies can remain in the same office or premise. 
However, the third copy should be stored offsite, in a different 
location from where the backup was created.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-671">By keeping a copy offsite, it is kept safe from any 
incidents involving the two copies at the main premise. Until a few 
years ago, offsite copies were generally stored in tapes and hard 
drives. However, some organizations have started to make an offsite 
backup on the cloud as well. In the offsite locations, tapes and hard 
drives are usually stored in a vault to ensure that in case of an 
incident, such as a flood, the backup copies are kept safe.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-672">It is important to consider distance when storing 
backup media on an offsite location. When you need to recover data, it 
may be critical to get your backup media as soon as possible, so a 
closer location may be a better choice.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m16-692"><b>Task 1 - Configure System Protection Settings</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m16-693">The System Protection feature in Windows 10 allows 
flexibility to roll back on the unwanted changes in the system. For 
example, if you loaded a new device driver for the network adapter but 
the device driver made Windows unstable, you can use the System 
Protection feature to undo these changes and bring the system back to 
the condition it was in before the device driver installation.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-694">System restore points are used for rollback purposes,
 which allow you to revert to a known working state. When created, a 
system restore point generates a snapshot of the system and then 
preserves it. When the system restore point is used, the system is 
brought to the state depicted by that snapshot.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m16-794"><b>Restoration Order </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m16-795">After you perform a backup, you may need to restore 
it. If you have been taking only a full backup every time, then it would
 likely be only one tape that contains the full backup (multiple if it 
was a large backup). However, the situation changes when you have the 
full backup and then incremental or differential backups afterwards. The
 restoration order is different for both of them. The restoration order 
defines the types of backups and their media that you need to restore 
the data.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-796">Here are some examples to demonstrate restoration order:</p>

<p id="cn-m16-797"><b>Example 1: </b></p>

<p id="cn-m16-798">You use a backup tool to perform a weekly full backup
 on Friday evening. You also take an incremental backup daily until 
Thursday. Again on Friday, you perform a full backup.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-799">In this scenario, if you need to restore the backup from Wednesday, you would need the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m16-800">

<li id="cn-m16-800">Full backup</li>

<li id="cn-m16-801">Incremental backups for Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m16-802"><b>Example 2: </b></p>

<p id="cn-m16-803">You perform a full backup weekly on a Friday, and a 
differential backup every day. If you need to restore the backup for 
Wednesday, you need the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m16-804">

<li id="cn-m16-804">Full backup</li>

<li id="cn-m16-805">Differential backups for Wednesday</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m16-806">Differential backups take longer than incremental 
backups, but less than a full backup. When you need to restore, you will
 need the last differential backup along with the last full backup. 
Incremental backups take less time to backup but a longer time to 
restore. The reason for the long restoration time is that you to have to
 use all incremental backups since the last full backup.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-807">No matter if you are using incremental or 
differential backups, you still need to have the full backup, which 
contains the large chunk of files.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m16-808"><b>Last Known Good Configuration</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m16-809">The last known good configuration is a tool that was 
provided in all versions of Windows up till Windows 7. After Windows 7, 
Microsoft removed this tool. The last known good configuration is a 
method to load the last version of Windows that worked well and booted.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-810">Often, when you load a device driver, or there is a 
malware attack, Windows can become unstable. For example, let’s say that
 you have updated the video card drivers in Windows 7. However, after 
you load the new device drivers, there are frequent hangs and crashes. 
You can determine that before loading the new device drivers, everything
 worked fine. To handle this situation, you could boot the Windows 7 
system with last known good configuration. Windows will then boot into 
the last working Windows configuration, and you will no longer have the 
last device drivers.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m16-811"><b>Live Boot Media</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m16-812">A live boot media can be created on a DVD or a USB 
drive. When you do not want to tamper with the existing operating system
 but want to work with another one, you can simply create a live boot 
media, which boots like normal media but does not save the 
configuration.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-813">For example, let’s assume that your system is 
infected with a virus. There are several live boot media available that 
have antivirus applications. You can simply boot from the live boot 
media and clean your system.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-814">A live boot media is a working operating system. 
Rather than storing the configuration files in the hard drive, this 
operating system loads the configuration files in the memory and then 
runs itself. Any changes that you make on the live boot media does not 
impact the actual operating system on the system. For example, if you 
have Windows 10 on a system and you use a Linux live boot media DVD, any
 files you modify in the live boot media will not impact Windows 10. 
When you shut down the Linux live boot media, it will restore itself to 
the same as it originally was on the DVD.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m16-815"><b>High Availability</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m16-816">If your organization is running a critical business 
application, the application must run without any downtime. However, it 
is virtually impossible to run any application or system without 
downtime, but still, most organizations tend to achieve 99.999% uptime, 
which is equivalent to <b>five minutes </b>of downtime throughout the year.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-817">You can achieve high availability of an application 
using redundancy and fault-tolerance methods. You can use failover 
clusters to add two or more servers, which are commonly known as nodes. 
One node continues to serve the clients. If there is any failure with 
the node, then the secondary node takes over and serves the clients 
instead. This would not affect their experience or notify them.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-818">Another method to achieve high availability is by 
using load balancers. You can distribute the load of the Web application
 amongst two or more servers that are running behind a load balancer. It
 is the job of the load balancer to distribute the load to the servers. 
If one server is running with high load, the next set of client requests
 are the passed on to the next server.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m16-819"><b>Scalability</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m16-820">Scalability is often a challenge when it comes to 
networks, systems, and applications. When you need to scale up, you have
 to add the physical hardware. However, to a great extent, this problem 
is solved by virtualization and containerization. Both can help you 
increase agility in the IT operations and can help you scale up and 
scale down the infrastructure as required.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-821">Each system you use has a certain level of resources,
 which are consumed by the operating system and applications. There are 
times when applications require more resources to provide optimal 
performance. However, if the system has run out of resources, then you 
have to look at scalability. You could add more resources to the system 
and gain optimal application performance. This method is known as 
scaling up.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-822">Alternatively, if there is no possibility of adding 
more resources to the system, then you can add another system to handle 
the load of the application. When you add another system, the 
application load can be split between both systems. This method is 
called scaling out.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-823">In summary, scalability means increasing the resources to meet the demands generated by the application(s).</p>

<p id="cn-m16-824">Cloud computing allows you to scale your IT 
infrastructure up or down on an on-demand basis. You can provision new 
servers, add or remove memory, or any other component when required, 
generally within minutes. For example, if you know that your Web server 
is going to be overloaded over a certain time period, you can scale up 
your infrastructure during that time, then scale back down afterwards.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m16-825"><b>Diversity</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m16-826">An organization has systems, servers, applications, 
and network devices, and it is essential to protect all of them. To be 
able to provide a sufficient level of security, the organization must 
use multiple layers of security, which is known as defense-in-depth. You
 build multiple layers of security controls to ensure that if the 
attacker breaks one layer of security controls, the remaining layers can
 still prevent them from proceeding further into the network.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-827">It is not only essential to build multiple layers of 
security controls but also to ensure that each layer is diverse. This 
prevents the attacker from using a single technique or method to break 
the security of all layers.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-828"><b><i>Technologies</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-829">It is always good to use various technologies rather 
than depending on a single type of technology. For example, a good 
mixture of technologies, such as databases, file servers, and 
Webservers. Each product should also be hardened before use.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-830"><b><i>Vendors</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-831">It is always better to use several vendors. When you 
are implementing various security controls, it is good to use different 
vendors, such as for firewall, IPS/IDS, and WAF. Even if the attacker 
knows the weaknesses of products from one vendor, the products from 
other vendors may still be more difficult for them to attack.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-832"><b><i>Crypto</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-833">Rather than making use of a single cryptographic 
method, it is good to make use of different methods. For example, during
 the transmission, IPSec is a good choice, but when data at rest, 
another cryptographic method should be used. This is because different 
cryptographic or encryption methods are used for different purposes. For
 example, IPSec is mainly used for securing data during transmission. 
You should use symmetric encryption for encrypting data on your hard 
drive. With symmetric encryption, you use the same encryption key to 
encrypt and decrypt the data.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m16-834"><b><i>Controls</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m16-835">An organization must install and configure diverse 
security controls, including administrative, technical, and physical 
controls.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-836">For example, to secure the premise, you need to 
implement physical controls, such as installing fences and having 
security guards.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-837">You can also implement administrative controls, such 
as policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines. For example, you can
 implement Email Security Policy that defines how Email should be used 
and the security parameters that should be followed.</p>

<p id="cn-m16-838">Finally, you have technical controls that can prevent
 various types of attacks against confidentiality and integrity. They 
also help with implementing access controls. Some examples are firewall,
 intrusion prevention and detection systems, CCTV, and fire detection 
systems.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-101">Physical security is as critical as logical security. 
In logical security, you secure the systems, servers, and network 
devices using various software and tools. However, physical security 
uses various methods and techniques to ensure the safety of the 
organization and its infrastructure.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-128"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m6-c-1" src="PhysicalSecurityControlMechanisms_files/image-m6-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-129"><b>Bollards/Barricades</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-130">Bollards are vertical posts that create a protective 
boundary around a building. They are usually designed to mark boundaries
 and prevent vehicles from entering a specific area. They are usually 
fixed into the ground. They prevent any vehicle to just pass through. 
You can also have collapsible bollards, which can be used to add 
stand-off distances, protect garages, and provide hostile surveillance. 
However, they are specifically useful where there may be a need to 
permit authorized traffic.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-131">Barricades prevent people from accessing a specific 
area. They can also be used for allowing vehicle access in a specific 
manner. For example, military areas usually have zigzag barricades, 
which forces the vehicles to slow down.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-132">Both bollards and barricades serve as deterrent control, which is designed to deter attackers.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-133"><b>Mantraps</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-134">Tailgaiting and piggybacking is a big problem for 
organizations and is considered to be one of the easiest methods to 
enter the premises. Tailgating is a social engineering act of gaining 
access to an electronically locked system or restricted area by 
following a user who has legitimate access, intending to access 
vulnerable information. When the legitimate user swipes his badge or 
enters the passcode to enter the building, you enter through the secured
 door before it closes by following the user.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-135">To prevent piggybacking and tailgating, you can 
implement mantrap. In a mantrap, only one person enters the mantrap, and
 the entry door closes. After the person authenticates himself or 
herself, the exit door opens. After the first person moves out of the 
exit door, the second person can enter the mantrap. Mantraps are 
installed to prevent tailgating and piggybacking.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-137"><b>Badges</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-138">In older times, ID badges contained the user’s 
photograph and some personal details, which were verified by the 
security guards. However, this scenario might also be continuing with 
some of the organizations. It is a problem to verify hundreds of users 
at any given time.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-139">One of the easiest solutions was to then use ID 
badges, which carries a magnetic strip within the ID cards, which could 
either be scanned or swiped. Once the card is scanned or swiped, the 
user is identified.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-140">A more recent invention is to use ID cards that carry 
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), which could be detected by the 
proximity reader. It could detect the ID card with RFID and authenticate
 the user. The ID card carrying RFID simply transmits the number to the 
proximity reader and based on the number, the user is identified.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-141"><b>Alarms</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-142">An alarm is a detective control, which is used for 
detecting malicious activity. Alarms, also known as security alarms, are
 nowadays used everywhere, at home, in industries, and even on military 
premises. Organizations install alarms that can be triggered if 
malicious activities are performed, such as breaking into the building.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-143">Let’s take an example. Your organization is housed in a
 four-story building. There is an alarm system at every door, which 
detects if anyone forcibly tries to open the door. If the door is 
forcibly opened, the alarm is triggered.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-144"><b>Signage</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-145">Signage plays a critical role in personnel safety. 
There may be certain areas that are accident prone or can be considered 
dangerous in a building. You would need to put appropriate signage so 
that people know that they are not supposed to be entering a particular 
area or room.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-146">Signage can be a warning or simple information. For example, signage may warn people about the danger of fire.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-147">Information signage may simply be placed outside a room, stating that it is a meeting room.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-148"><b>CCTV Cameras</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-149">CCTV cameras can detect unauthorized entrance, but 
they cannot prevent it.  Usually, lock picking does not leave any 
external damage and therefore is hard to prove that it ever took place. A
 security camera can also work as a deterrent and provide proof in any 
legal proceedings.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-150"><b>Motion Detection </b></p>

<p id="cn-m6-151">These cameras identify moving objects. They extract 
the overall boundaries of an object, and if the object moves out of the 
boundary, then the motion vectors are calculated. With the calculation 
of the motion vectors, the new position of the objects in motion is 
calculated. Good use of these cameras can be at front doors or even at 
the entrance to a server room.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-152"><b>Object Detection </b></p>

<p id="cn-m6-153">Object detection is mainly used to detect specific 
objects. For example, you can put a camera on the street to figure out 
objects in motion. When an object is identified, a rectangle is drawn 
around it to make it look different from the other objects.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-155"><b>Industrial Camouflage</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-156">To protect a company’s data and network 
infrastructure, camouflage techniques can be used to disguise specific 
characteristics of the company’s network infrastructure. This can be 
achieved by creating decoy systems that are masquerading as the 
legitimate system. For example, when an attacker attempts to breach the 
network or has already gained unlawful access to the decoy system, their
 behavior and objectives can be monitored. This information can then be 
used to harden the production environment to prevent potential attacks 
and exploits.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-157"><b>Personnel</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-158">There are different personnel who play a critical role
 in physical security. Let’s have a look at each of these personnel and 
their roles.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-159"><b><i>Guards</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-160">To protect a building or a premise, you can deploy 
fences, bollards, and barricades. However, these are passive methods. On
 the other hand, guards are active entities that can question the 
individual entering the premises. Based on their decisions, they can 
judge whether a person is malicious or genuine.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-161">In most organizations, guards are deployed at the main
 gate, as well as the entrance of the building. In some cases, guards 
not only make an entry of the visitor in their visitor logbook but also 
carry the responsibility of monitoring the CCTV cameras.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-162"><b><i>Robot Sentries</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-163">Robot sentries are autonomous robots who are designed 
to patrol a specific area. They are unmanned, which means that they 
function on their own. In some cases, such as borders, they may be 
armed. In some countries, they are deployed to guard critical 
infrastructure, such as a nuclear plant. Even though robot sentries are 
autonomous, they are still remotely controlled by humans.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-164"><b><i>Reception</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-165">Almost all organizations have receptions. One of the 
reception's key functions is to attend to visitors and ensure that the 
visitors sit in the designated areas. Only after authorization from an 
employee can they proceed to a specific area where the meeting needs to 
be held.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-166">Several organizations also have Webcams placed on the 
reception to make an entry pass for the visitors. The entry pass has the
 visitor’s photograph and also has a place for the employee signature 
who attends the visitors.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-167"><b><i>Two-person Integrity/Control</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-168">Two-person integrity (TPI) is a type of Separation of 
Duties (SoD). In a critical task, two people are required to complete 
the task. For example, if there is a finance approval required, you 
would need two levels of approvals before the payment can be made out to
 an individual or a vendor. Another example that would fit well in this 
context is the bank locker. You would need your key, and then another 
key that belongs to bank personnel. Both keys are required to open the 
locker. The bank personnel cannot simply open the locker with a single 
key.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-169"><b>Locks</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-170">Locks are essential for any house or building to 
secure them from any kind of theft. Depending on the criticality and 
importance of the objects, you may put a specific type of lock. Let’s 
understand the types of locks that can be used to secure a building or 
premise.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-171"><b><i>Physical</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-172">A physical lock is either installed on the door or can
 be an individual lock. A physical lock is opened with a key. Typically,
 a physical lock would have three to four copies of the keys. There are 
several varieties of physical locks. One is a residential keyed entry 
lock. On the outside of the lock, you have a knob, and it contains a key
 entry hole. This type of lock is mostly used in houses.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-173">The other type is the deadbolt lock, which is mostly 
used in commercial complexes. This type of lock has a solid metal bar 
that gets inserted into the wall for secure locking. As compared to the 
residential entry lock, the deadbolt lock provides higher security 
because you would have to cut the metal bar to open it. Both of these 
types of locks require a key to lock and unlock.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-174"><b><i>Electronic</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-175">Electronic locks use a key combination to open. You 
have to press a series of numbers in a particular order to open the 
electronic lock. An advanced version of an electronic lock is a cipher 
lock, which has more features. You can program it to make it work for a 
certain time. For example, you can program to make it work only from 8 
AM to 6 PM during weekdays. The rest of the time and on weekends, the 
cipher lock will not work.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-176"><b><i>Biometric</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-177">Biometric locks usually have a fingerprint scanner. 
When you place the finger on the lock, it scans the fingerprint, and 
depending upon if you are a legitimate user, it authorizes your entry by
 unlocking the door. Some biometric locks also have a numeric keypad and
 manual lock, which require a key for the lock.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-178">More sophisticated biometric locks can also include a retina scan. However, most of them have fingerprint scan capabilities.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-179"><b><i>Cable locks</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-180">Imagine a scenario where you need to put several 
laptops in an exhibition where visitors would like to experience your 
product. In the previous exhibition, two laptops were stolen. Since 
there are thousands of visitors daily, you want to ensure that the 
laptops are protected from theft. The ideal solution would be to use 
cable locks, which protect the laptops from any physical theft.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-181">Most portable devices, such as laptops, have a 
security slot where the cable lock is placed and locked. The lock is 
connected to the cable, which has another end that is tied to the desk.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-182"><b>USB Data Blocker</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-183">A USB data blocker is a small USB device that is 
plugged into the USB port of a charging station. It is quite difficult 
to determine if a public charging station is prone to deliver malware or
 steal data from your phone when you plug it in. The USB data blocker 
prevents any kind of infection in your phone from the charging station. 
You need to plug in the USB data blocker into the charging station and 
then plug in your phone cable into the USB data blocker, which adds a 
layer of protection. Your phone is still charged, but the hackers cannot
 extract data.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-185"><b>Lighting</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-186">It is easy for an intruder to sneak into a building 
when it is dark. Lighting is a deterrent control that prevents intruders
 from breaking into a building. Consider a scenario if your building has
 security cameras, but it is dark inside the building. The cameras won’t
 be able to capture any clear picture. If someone breaks into the 
building, you will never be able to find out anything from the video 
recordings. More lighting means more security. The cameras have a clear 
view when there are proper lightings installed.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-187"><b>Fencing</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-188">Fences are usually installed to guard the perimeter of
 a building. Fences should be tall enough to prevent anyone from 
climbing over. To make it even more difficult for the intruder, you can 
also install razor wire on top of the fence.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-189">Fences should be strong enough to be knocked down by 
an individual. Depending on the requirement, the fencing may be 
see-through. It could also be opaque, which prevents an individual from 
finding out what is on the other side.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-190"><b>Fire Suppression</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-191">A fire within a building can break out anytime, and 
most of the time, the reasons can only be found after you have managed 
to put out the fire. However, by this time, you have incurred huge 
losses as most of the equipment is damaged and left unusable. The fire 
suppression system should be placed in the most critical place of the 
building, which is the data center.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-192">You can install a water sprinkler system in other 
places of the building, which can simply get triggered when there is a 
fire. However, in the server room or data center, a water sprinkler 
system would make things worse and can cause more damage to the 
equipment. The most suitable solution is to install a fire suppression 
system.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-193">A fire suppression system has components that detect 
the fire through various stages, such as heat, smoke, and then fire. 
Most fire suppression systems have a built-in alarm system, which gets 
triggered when a fire is detected. Depending on the type of fire 
suppression system, it can either release the fire extinguishing 
substance automatically or manually.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-194"><b>Sensors</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-195">Sensors can be used for various purposes. They can be 
used to detect motion or even in the proximity reader to detect ID cards
 with RFID. Sensors can also be used for monitoring temperatures.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-196">Let’s look at some of the key purposes where sensors play a critical role.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-197"><b><i>Motion Detection</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-198">Motion detection sensors work on their capability to 
detect the motion of objects. For example, consider that you have a room
 where a critical server is kept. No one is supposed to be entering the 
room. You have motion detection sensors installed. Now, if a moving 
object is detected, then an audible alarm can be triggered.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-199"><b><i>Noise Detection</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-200">Noise detection sensor has the capability of detecting
 various types of noises. For example, if it detects a large thump 
noise, it can trigger an alarm.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-201"><b><i>Proximity Reader</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-202">A proximity reader is used with ID cards or any other 
type of card that carries RFID. When the ID card is moved close to the 
proximity reader, its details are captured.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-203"><b><i>Moisture Detection</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-204">In data centers in an organization, detecting moisture
 is critical. For example, water condensation can cause various 
problems, such as corrosion, rust, and short-circuiting. On the other 
hand, no or missing moisture can cause electrostatic discharge. 
Therefore, in most of the server rooms, you will find that there are 
moisture detection sensors, which reports about moisture regularly.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-205"><b><i>Temperature</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-206">There is no doubt that the server rooms or data 
centers generate a large amount of heat. You need to have methods to 
measure the appropriate temperature, whether hot or cold. You need to 
ensure that the temperature is appropriate, which can be done with the 
help of temperature sensors. Temperature sensors can be of two types - 
contact-based and non-contact-based. Contact-based temperature sensors 
need to be connected with the object. On the other hand, 
non-contact-based temperature sensors can use convection and radiation 
to monitor temperature change.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-207"><b>Drones/UAV</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-208">A drone is an Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV). It is a 
small aerial vehicle that is used for various purposes, such as 
surveillance. It can fly with a controlled flight plan and is controlled
 through sensors and GPS.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-209">A drone works with two different signals: rising and 
downlink signals. The drone receives rising signals. The rising signals 
can be in the form of radio command or GPS signals. However, these can 
be replaced by the lure signals that are sent by an attacker. The lure 
signals replace the rising signals to allow the attacker to take control
 of the fly drone. The attacker can then change the flying path of the 
drone.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-210">The drone sends the downlink signals. The signals may 
contain the flight information or video transmission, both of which can 
be intercepted by the attacker. Video transmission is typically being 
transmitted in an unsecured manner that is susceptible to interception.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-211">The downlink and rising signals are not protected or 
rather encrypted. Therefore, both the signals can be intercepted and 
allow the attacker to modify the transmission or take control of the 
drone.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-212"><b>Visitor Logs</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-213">When a visitor enters an organization’s premises, the 
guards should make an entry in the visitor logs. Along with the entry, 
the exit of the visitor should also be logged. Some of the key 
information that should be captured about the visitor is as follows:</p>

<ul id="cn-m6-214">

<li id="cn-m6-214">Name of the visitor</li>

<li id="cn-m6-215">Organization of the visitor</li>

<li id="cn-m6-216">Entry date and time</li>

<li id="cn-m6-217">Exit date and time</li>

<li id="cn-m6-218">Mobile number</li>

<li id="cn-m6-219">Name of the employee to whom the visitor needs to meet</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m6-220">Many organizations have removed the physical entry 
method, which was to capture the details in a register. Some 
organizations create a temporary visitor card that is valid for a fixed 
duration and also mentions the areas that the visitor is authorized to 
visit.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-221">Some organizations create a small printed slip with 
all the required details and require the concerned employee to sign the 
slip before leaving the premises.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-222">Whichever method that you use depends on your 
organization. However, it is highly critical that the visitor log be 
reviewed from time to time, perhaps daily, to ensure that all visitors 
have left the premises. If you are complying with a security standard, 
then the visitor logs are likely to be reviewed as part of the 
compliance audit.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-223"><b>Faraday Cages</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-224">A Faraday cage is a type of enclosure that blocks any 
type of electromagnetic interference. It is commonly used with devices, 
such as mobile phones, when you want to prevent them from any electronic
 interference. You can simply put the mobile device in the Faraday cage.
 Once you put the mobile into this package, it cannot be remotely 
accessed. In the forensics field, these packages are commonly used to 
prevent the mobile from being accessed and to retain mobile content.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-225"><b>Air Gap</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-226">Air gap is the segmentation of a network without any 
connectivity between the segments. An air gap doesn’t allow free flow of
 information even from within an organization’s LAN. Data can move 
low-to-high (unclassified to classified) with minimal processes, whereas
 high-to-low requires much more stringent procedures to ensure the 
protection of the data at a higher level of classification. An air gap 
is not 100% immune to viruses and malware attacks. Few viruses that use 
acoustic signaling may bridge the gap and reach a secure network.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-227">Air gap networks are typically used with high security
 networks, such as military, financial organizations, industrial 
controls systems, and life-critical systems, such as nuclear plants.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-228"><b>Protected Cable Distribution</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-229">Protected cable distribution is about using a carrier 
that encases the cables, which in most cases, are the network cables. 
There are two reasons for using protected cable distribution. The first 
reason is that it protects the network cables from being damaged. The 
second reason is that it protects the network cables from any kind of 
cable tapping, which is used to extract the signals flowing over the 
cable.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-230"><b>Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-231">A DMZ is a logically separated network from the 
internal network and allows the servers to be placed where it needs to 
be visible to the outside network. The network communication between the
 internal and the DMZ needs to be encrypted.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-232">The Web server should be placed in the DMZ for public 
access, and the database server should be placed on the internal 
network. The database server should remain on the internal network so 
that if the Web server is compromised, the database server is still 
safe.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-233">The servers in the DMZ have access to the Internet, 
but they do not have access to the internal network, which in turn can 
access the servers in the DMZ. This type of configuration is for 
security reasons. This ensures that even if an attacker(s) gain control 
of a server in DMZ, they cannot access the internal network.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-234"><b>Secure Areas</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-235">A secure area refers to an area that has limited 
access to users and other entities. Be it the network where the servers 
are connected or how the server racks are stacked in the data center. It
 could be a logical entity that stores the usernames and passwords. 
Let’s look at some of these secure areas.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-236"><b><i>Vault</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-237">A vault is a special folder or tool that is used for 
storing the user credentials and certificates. It can also store 
private, and personal files that you consider are confidential. You need
 to install a tool, such as McAfee LiveSafe, and create a vault. Once 
you do that, you need to unlock and put your files in it. After this, 
you need to lock the vault once again.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-238">When you lock the vault, a set of vault files are 
created on your hard drive or a USB drive. You need to ensure that you 
safeguard the vault files because if they are lost, then you will lose 
the data inside the vault.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-239"><b><i>Safe</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-240">You may be taking backups from the server on tapes or 
any other media. However, to be able to safeguard the media from falling
 into the wrong hands, you need to put them under lock and key, which 
simply means using a safe. A safe can be manually operated, which means 
you need to have a key. Alternatively, it could also work with a digital
 key lock, which means you need to have the number combination to open 
the safe.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-241">Whichever type of safe you use, you have to ensure 
that you do not let the keys or number combination fall into the wrong 
hands. Access to the safe should be highly restricted. Anyone with 
access to the safe must also make a log entry with the date and time and
 the purpose of using the safe.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-242"><b><i>Hot and Cold Aisle</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-243">There are usually numerous numbers of devices in a 
data center, ranging from routers, switches to servers. Each of these 
generates quite a bit of heat, especially the servers stacked up in 
server racks.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-244">In a cold aisle, you need to put the fronts of the 
racks facing each other. The fronts create the cold aisle, whereas the 
backs create the hot aisle.  The HVAC airflow would exhaust the hot air 
outside the data center and bring in fresh air to the cold aisle.</p>

<p id="cn-m6-248">When you delete data from a Windows system, it is soft
 delete. This means that the data is actually not deleted from the hard 
drive. This is because the files in Windows are tracked using the File 
Allocation Table (FAT) or using the Master File Table (MFT). FAT or MFT 
keeps track of the beginning and end of a file. When you delete a file 
from the hard drive, the operating system, Windows, in this case, 
deletes the pointer that is linked with the file. This pointer is 
responsible for pointing to the file. When the pointer is deleted, the 
space for its related file is marked available. To the user, the file is
 now deleted as space is shown as free. However, the actual files are 
not deleted and can be recovered by data recovery programs, such as 
Recuva. Some of the well-known data recovery programs are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m6-249">

<li id="cn-m6-249">Recuva</li>

<li id="cn-m6-250">Wise&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Recovery</li>

<li id="cn-m6-251">Stellar&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Recovery</li>

<li id="cn-m6-252">PC Inspector&nbsp;File&nbsp;Recovery</li>

<li id="cn-m6-253">EaseUS&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Recovery&nbsp;Wizard&nbsp;Free</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m6-254">In this exercise, you will learn to use data destruction and disposal methods.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m6-256">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<h3 id="cn-m6-263"><b>Data Destruction Methods</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m6-264">There are several data destruction and media 
sanitization methods. Some of them will destroy the media to ensure that
 the data cannot be recovered. Other methods will simply make the media 
unusable so that it cannot be used for data recovery.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-265"><b><i>Pulverizing</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-266">Shredding and pulverizing data devices use the same 
method of destruction. Physical destruction methods such as using 
high-powered devices are used to destroy these devices to ensure the 
data on these devices is not recoverable at all. Care must be taken 
before these devices are destroyed, ensuring that no data will be needed
 in the future.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-267"><b><i>Degaussing</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-268">The degaussing method uses an electromagnet to wipe 
off the data and make the media useless. This makes the drive completely
 inoperable and impossible to recover any data from it.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-269"><b><i>Drilling </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-270">The drilling method uses a hammer and nails to destroy
 a hard drive. You can hammer the nails in the hard drive that creates 
holes to prevent the drive from spinning. Using this method, you can 
also damage the read/write head of the hard drive to ensure that no data
 can be recovered.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-271"><b><i>Pulping</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-272">The pulping method is used to destroy sensitive data 
on papers. It can be used with shredded or non-shredded paper. The ink 
is separated from the paper using the flotation method, and then fiber 
is removed. After the water dries out, the pulp is created and then 
converted into recycled paper.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-273"><b><i>Shredding</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-274">Shredding is the process of destroying sensitive paper
 documents using a paper shredder. Paper shredders cut the paper into 
small sizes, which is almost impossible to put back together again. Care
 must be taken when disposing of these shredded documents to ensure that
 it does not fall into the wrong hands.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m6-275"><b><i>Burning</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m6-276">Another method for destroying sensitive paper 
documents is by burning these documents, which will ensure it will be 
totally unrecoverable. An incinerator can be used specifically for this 
task.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-133">Mobile devices have various options to share data. In
 some cases, two mobile devices can be kept near to each other, and data
 can be sent from one to the other. For example, two mobile devices may 
share data over a Bluetooth connection. On the other hand, a mobile 
device may simply need to download a file from cloud storage. For this 
purpose, you may have to use a cellular or wireless method to download 
the file. Even though there is no right or wrong method to share 
information, it may depend on the need and scenario type.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-134">In this exercise, you will learn about connection methods and receivers.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-149"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m27-c-1" src="MobileSecuritySolutions_files/image-m27-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-151"><b>Cellular</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-152">A cellular network is the type of network that 
provides network and data services to mobile devices. In this context, 
data services are the amount of data that a mobile device can consume 
while using the Internet or its services, such as audio and video.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-153">A cellular network makes use of the telephony 
circuits that are divided into cells. A cellular network covers a large 
area, such as a country. The cells within the cellular network are 
designed to cover a specific location within the larger area. Even 
though 3G is now almost obsolete, several cellular service providers are
 still being used for backward connectivity. While 4G is the current 
cellular standard, 5G is the next version, but it is not standardized 
yet.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-154"><b>Wi-Fi</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-155">Wi-Fi or wireless networks allow mobile devices to 
connect and move around. When there is no cellular connectivity, these 
devices can connect with a wireless network and use Internet services. 
There are different types of wireless networks that use the 2.4 to 5 GHz
 spectrum. Each type of wireless network also offers a different speed.</p>

<span class="cn-quote" id="cn-m27-156"><b><i>Note: </i></b><i>Types of wireless networks are covered in detail in the </i><b><i>Implementing Wireless Security Configurations </i></b><i>module.</i></span>

<h3 id="cn-m27-157"><b>Bluetooth</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-158">Bluetooth is a wireless protocol that has a limited 
range. An older version of Bluetooth, up to 4.2, can connect to other 
Bluetooth devices within the 32-feet or 10 meters range. However, the 
recent version, which is 5.x, can connect to devices even 200 feet or 60
 meters. Bluetooth uses the 2.4 GHz frequency band, which is the same as
 used by some wireless networks.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-159">Nowadays, several devices have Bluetooth features. 
For example, there are printers, tablets, watches, and headphones or 
earplugs that have Bluetooth capability. You need to pair two Bluetooth 
devices for them to communicate with each other. Let’s consider the 
example of two mobile devices. The first one finds the second Bluetooth 
device and initiates the pairing. The first mobile device then sends a 
pairing request and a key that the second mobile device needs to accept.
 Once the second mobile device accepts the pairing, the pairing process 
is complete. The second mobile device, while pairing, can choose to 
share contacts and call history with the first mobile device.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-160"><b>Near-field Communication (NFC)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-161">Near-field Communication (NFC) is a method to 
establish connectivity within limited proximity, which is about 3.9 
inches or 10 cm. Both devices need to have NFS capability. When both the
 devices are brought within said proximity, the connection is 
established. Then, both mobile devices can share pictures, contacts, and
 other data with each other.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-162">Other than mobile devices, other devices in the 
market use NFC. For example, instead of swapping your credit card in 
shopping malls, it is flashed within the proximity of the credit card 
machine. A connection is established, and then the amount is charged to 
the credit card. However, both the credit card and the credit card 
machine need to have NFC capabilities.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-163"><b>Infrared</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-164">Infrared is a type of radiant energy that is not 
visible to humans. However, a receiving device with an infrared port 
receives the infrared and performs a designated action. For example, a 
TV remote has infrared that is used to perform certain actions on the 
TV. You can turn on, change channels, increase and decrease volume, and 
even turn off the TV.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-165">The receiving device must be in clear sight to 
receive inputs from an infrared device. A solid wall or object will make
 the infrared light bounce back, and the receiving device will not 
receive the signal. For example, if someone stands in front of the TV 
and you try to change the channel, you cannot do it. This is because the
 infrared signals are being bounced back. Some of the mobile devices 
also have infrared capability.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-166"><b>USB</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-167">USB has been around for several years. Just like any 
other technology, it has also gone through several upgrades. Most of the
 devices have a Type-A connector. Then, mobile devices had a mini-USB 
port. Later, the mini-USB port was upgraded to micro-USB. Of lately, 
several mobile devices use a Type-C connector.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-168">Other than the connectors, the USB transfer speeds also evolved with the versions. Here are some key versions:</p>

<ul id="cn-m27-169">

<li id="cn-m27-169">USB 1.x - 12 Mbps</li>

<li id="cn-m27-170">USB 2.0 - 480 Mbps</li>

<li id="cn-m27-171">USB 3.0 - 5.0 Gbps</li>

<li id="cn-m27-172">USB 3.1 - 10 Gbps</li>

<li id="cn-m27-173">USB 3.2 - 20 Gbps</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m27-174"><b>Point-to-Point</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-175">A point-to-point connection is made between two 
devices. These devices can be two mobile devices. An example of a 
point-to-point connection is a telephone call, which one person makes to
 another person. In this type of connection, there is a dedicated link 
that is established between two devices. The bandwidth of the connection
 can be consumed by both the devices that are connected to it. One end 
acts as a sender, and the other end acts as a receiver.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-176"><b>Point-to-Multipoint</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-177">Unlike point-to-point, there is one sender and 
multiple receivers in point-to-multipoint. The bandwidth is shared 
between these devices that are connected to this type of connection. One
 of the devices acts as a sender, and the remaining devices act as 
receivers.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-178"><b>Global Positioning System (GPS)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-179">GPS is a global navigation satellite-based system. 
Even though it can have varied uses, such as time synchronization, it is
 mainly used for navigation and location tracking. Google Maps uses GPS 
to provide the exact location that you look for.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-180">GPS is commonly used nowadays. For example, several 
different car models are equipped with GPS systems that helps the person
 navigate to a specific location.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-181"><b>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-182">RFID is used for identifying tags that are attached 
to different objects. For example, RFID tags can be found on hardware 
devices in an organization. The tags help the administrator track these 
devices. RFID is a contactless technology that uses radio waves to 
identify the tags attached to different objects.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-183">There are two types of RFID tags. The first type is 
the one that has its own power source and is known as active tags. The 
second type uses the RFID energy that is sent to them for 
identification. This type uses this energy to charge itself. An example 
of RFID can be found in security systems that authenticate users with a 
smart card without touching them. When a user needs to enter a door that
 is protected by a security lock, the user simply flashes the smart card
 in front of the security lock, and if authenticated, the user is given 
access.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m27-184"><b>Exercise 2 - Mobile Device Management (MDM)</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m27-185">Most organizations now allow the use of mobile phones
 to share their data. However, there is always a risk of data being 
stolen or the mobile phone being compromised.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-186">It can be difficult to manage devices, and this is 
where Mobile Device Management (MDM) comes in. MDM is a feature used in 
an enterprise network to keep a mobile device environment secure. MDM 
can control, configure, update, and secure remote mobile devices.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-187">Using MDM, you can block rooting, jailbreaking, or 
any other feature you do not want the employees to use. MDM also allows 
you to restrict the use of any application other than the approved 
applications from your app store.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-188">MDM can be used to enable geofencing, which alerts 
the administrator if a user leaves the defined perimeter. Alongside 
this, you can also configure asset tracking. Even if the SIM is changed,
 you would be able to locate the device.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-189">An organization should also use the following methods when using MDM:</p>

<ul id="cn-m27-190">

<li id="cn-m27-190">Enable the Remote Location feature</li>

<li id="cn-m27-191">Enable the Remote Wipe feature</li>

<li id="cn-m27-192">Enable encryption</li>

<li id="cn-m27-193">Allow installation of apps from your organization’s app store</li>

<li id="cn-m27-194">Allow specific apps to be installed using blacklisting and whitelisting</li>

<li id="cn-m27-195">Use password enforcement</li>

<li id="cn-m27-196">Perform device inventory and management</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m27-197">In this exercise, you will learn about mobile security solutions.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m27-199">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m27-200">

<li id="cn-m27-200">Application Management</li>

<li id="cn-m27-201">Content Management</li>

<li id="cn-m27-202">Remote Wipe</li>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m27-214">This exercise contains supporting materials for Security+.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-215"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m27-c-2" src="MobileSecuritySolutions_files/image-m27-c-2.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-216"><b>Application Management</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-217">With the default settings on a mobile device, a user 
can install several apps. However, what if an organization does not want
 the users to install any apps or install apps only from a list of 
authorized ones. In this scenario, the only possible solution is to use 
MDM to manage mobile devices. With the use of MDM, you will be able to 
restrict the use of any application other than the approved applications
 from your app store.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-218">Even though there are specialized Application 
Management applications that help you achieve this goal, MDM also 
includes this feature.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-219"><b>Content Management</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-220">When users are carrying mobile devices, content 
management becomes a major issue. The organizational information can be 
difficult to track on mobile devices. The Content Management feature of 
MDM solves this problem for you. You can control the content on the 
users’ mobile devices. For example, a user may not be able to download a
 file due to access limitations, but at the same time, another user can 
download, edit, and upload the file back in the mobile app.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-221"><b>Remote Wipe</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-222">One of the key features of an MDM application is 
Remote Wipe. If the mobile device containing corporate data is lost, you
 can use the Remote Wipe feature to completely wipe the mobile storage, 
erase sensitive data and its configuration.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-223">As a precautionary measure, you can enable full 
device encryption. This will ensure that the data remains secure and 
confidential, even if it is stolen.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-224"><b>Geofencing</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-225">Another use of MDM is to enable geofencing. When this
 feature is enabled, the administrator receives an alert if a user 
leaves the defined perimeter. Geofencing requires the administrator to 
define a perimeter, then it can be configured to send an alert if the 
user moves out of the perimeter.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-226">For example, geofencing can be used in a secure area 
where limited users are allowed. If an unauthorized user enters the 
secure area, it can trigger the administrator. Similarly, an 
organization may use the geofencing feature to track when users enter or
 leave the office premises.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-227"><b>Geolocation</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-228">Using the geolocation feature, you can track a mobile
 device. The geolocation feature is typically used to collect a variety 
of data for different purposes. For example, you can use this method to 
collect data from a set of existing customers so that you can find out 
how many customers are using your product. Another example could be of a
 bank that collects data from existing customers to figure out where to 
install an ATM.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-229">Geolocation can work either with the network routing 
addresses or using the GPS feature built-in the mobile device. Each 
mobile device connected to the Internet has an IP address, which can be 
used for geolocation.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-230"><b>Screen Locks</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-231">A mobile device can be configured with screen locks 
after being idle for a few minutes. Screen locks can be opened using a 
password, pin, or pattern recognition method. In several mobile devices,
 a biometric method can be used to open the screen lock. When a mobile 
device’s screen is turned off, or the mobile device is in sleep mode, 
you need to unlock the screen before getting into the mobile device.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-232">Using a screen lock ensures that an unauthorized user
 cannot open the mobile device and read through the information stored 
on it.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-233"><b>Push Notifications</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-234">Push notifications are used by mobile apps to 
indicate a message to a user. Push notifications intend to inform the 
user about a specific action or task that has been performed or needs to
 be performed. For example, if you are using an Android mobile device, 
you may have received a message on the screen that an upgrade is 
available. This message is a push notification.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-235">Another example can be a notification from a game 
that is installed on the mobile device. You may receive a notification 
that you have received 100 gold coins in the game.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-236"><b>Passwords and Pins</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-237">The same way a person can log onto an operating 
system on a laptop or a desktop, they can configure a password or pin to
 be entered to give access to their mobile device. Every time a person 
wants to access the mobile device, they must enter either the password 
or the pin. This keeps unauthorized users from accessing information on 
said device.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-238">It is important to note that you have to then perform
 a factory reset if the password or pin is lost. Other than a password 
or pin, most mobile devices also have the pattern recognition feature to
 draw a specific pattern on the mobile device screen before it can be 
unlocked.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-239">When managing the mobile device using MDM, you can 
enable the mobile device to be remotely wiped if a certain amount of 
incorrect passwords or pins have been entered.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-240"><b>Biometrics</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-241">Several types of mobile devices are enabled with 
biometric features, such as fingerprint scanning and face recognition. A
 user can either enable a password, pin, pattern recognition, or the 
biometric method to authenticate themselves on the mobile device.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-242">If you want to use the strongest authentication 
method on a mobile device, the correct answer is biometric. Even though a
 password or pin provides optimal security in locking the mobile device,
 they can be guessed or known by another person. However, biometric 
authentication can be considered as a full-proof method.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-243"><b>Context-aware Authentication</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-244">Unlike the traditional method of authenticating a 
user using a password, context-aware authentication is dynamic. Let’s 
look at a typical authentication method. A user provides a username and 
password to authenticate himself or herself. Multi-factor authentication
 requires the user to authenticate using an additional method. 
Context-aware authentication can use several different methods based on 
the trust the system has in the user. Context-aware authentication can 
also work based on resource utilization. Context-aware authentication, 
depending on the user analysis, may increase or decrease the level of 
identification.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-245">Some of the key factors that are considered as context-aware authentication:</p>

<ul id="cn-m27-246">

<li id="cn-m27-246">MAC address of the destination device</li>

<li id="cn-m27-247">Username</li>

<li id="cn-m27-248">Resources being accessed</li>

<li id="cn-m27-249">Time of the day</li>

<li id="cn-m27-250">Location of the mobile device</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m27-251"><b>Containerization</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-252">Using MDM, you can implement a method so that each 
mobile device separates the organization’s applications and data from 
the employee’s applications and data. This method is known as 
containerization, which creates a separate container on the mobile 
device, separating the employee’s applications and data from the 
organizations.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-253">Using the containerization feature, you can segregate
 the personal and organizational data. You can encrypt only the data 
that needs to be used by the organizational applications. You can think 
of containerization as a sandbox where only limited options are 
available for users. For example, with organizational applications, you 
cannot copy information to personal applications. It is also possible 
for the administrator to remotely remove information from a mobile 
device managed by MDM.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-254"><b>Storage Segmentation</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-255">After implementing MDM, you can impose different 
access controls on specific data types that an employee has on their 
mobile phone. Access control can be imposed on built-in storage as well 
as removable media. Using MDM, you can use storage segmentation, which 
helps you impose different access controls on specific data types, which
 can help you segregate personal and organizational data on a mobile 
device. Unlike containerization, which includes applications and data, 
storage segmentation only focuses on the data and how it can be secured 
by segmentation.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-256">For example, when an employee uses their mobile 
device to store organizational information, you have no control over how
 the information or applications are stored without MDM. With MDM, you 
can create storage segmentation, which can segregate personal from 
organizational applications and data.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-257"><b>Full Device Encryption</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-258">Full device encryption ensures that the data remains 
secure and confidential, even if the data is stolen. This can be 
achieved using MDM. When you encrypt a mobile device using full disk 
encryption, an encryption key is generated. The user needs to provide 
the encryption key to access the data. If the user does not have the 
key, then access to the data is not granted.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-259">For example, if the mobile device is stolen, its data
 is still secure and remains confidential without removing it from the 
device. A person cannot decrypt the phone without the encryption key.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m27-260"><b>Exercise 3 - Mobile Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m27-261">When working with mobile devices, security, 
management, and control is always a concern. Without any monitoring and 
management application, you cannot ensure device security. With the 
development in technologies, several new applications, such as MDM, have
 come into existence that allows you to secure, manage, and control 
devices. Besides the mobile device hardware, you also need to control 
the applications and data that reside and are transmitted from it.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-262">In this exercise, you will learn about several technologies that help you secure, manage, and control mobile devices.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m27-264">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m27-265">

<li id="cn-m27-265">MicroSD HSM</li>

<li id="cn-m27-266">MDM/Unified Endpoint Management (UEM)</li>

<li id="cn-m27-267">Mobile Application Management (MAM)</li>

<li id="cn-m27-268">SEAndroid</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m27-270">This exercise contains supporting materials for Security+.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-271"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m27-c-3" src="MobileSecuritySolutions_files/image-m27-c-3.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-273"><b>MicroSD HSM</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-274">The HSM modules are typically available in the form 
of a PCIe card, mainly used with the servers considered mission-critical
 or hosting mission-critical applications. These cards were also used in
 the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Because of its size, it cannot be 
used with mobile devices. Therefore, to resolve this problem, the 
MicroSD form factor, also known as μSD/X, was developed. It fits into 
the memory card slot or MicroSD card slot, which is available on almost 
all mobile devices.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-275">μSD/X is a hardware security module coming in the form of a microSD card.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-276">MicroSD HSM can perform several functions, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m27-277">

<li id="cn-m27-277">Encryption key lifecycle, including key import, key use counter, key restrictions, key backup, and restore</li>

<li id="cn-m27-278">Data at rest and in-process protection</li>

<li id="cn-m27-279">Support for storage encryption</li>

<li id="cn-m27-280">Perform hardware-based authentication</li>

<li id="cn-m27-281">Encryption and decryption</li>

<li id="cn-m27-282">Support for various encryption algorithms, such as AES, RSA, SHA1, SHA256 and Triple DES</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m27-283"><b>MDM/Unified Endpoint Management (UEM)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-284">Organizations are growing at a fast pace, and so are 
the IT assets within these organizations. Whether the organization is in
 manufacturing or IT services, IT assets are present in all 
organizations. Unlike previously, where the IT assets were limited to 
servers, desktops, switches, and routers, you now have employees 
carrying mobile devices and laptops. For an organization, it becomes 
difficult to manage IT assets. For example, if a sales representative is
 on tour most of the time, there is no guarantee that his laptop is 
being updated with the latest patches.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-285">To resolve such a problem, you can implement Unified 
Endpoint Management (UEM) to track the IT assets. Some of the key 
features that can help the IT administrator manage and administer IT 
assets are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m27-286">

<li id="cn-m27-286">Operating system deployment</li>

<li id="cn-m27-287">Software deployment</li>

<li id="cn-m27-288">Remote management</li>

<li id="cn-m27-289">License management</li>

<li id="cn-m27-290">Software and hardware inventory</li>

<li id="cn-m27-291">Updates management</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m27-292">These are some of the key features of UEM. An administrator can use UEM to perform day to day administrative tasks.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-293"><b>Mobile Application Management (MAM)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-294">Like MDM, MAM is another mobile solution, but it 
focuses on application management rather than mobile hardware. Using the
 MAM solution, you can manage an entire app lifecycle on a mobile 
device, which starts with installation and ends with the removal or 
deletion of the app from a mobile device.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-295">In the app lifecycle, you can perform certain tasks, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m27-296">

<li id="cn-m27-296">Manage licenses</li>

<li id="cn-m27-297">Define and manage permissions</li>

<li id="cn-m27-298">Perform configurations</li>

<li id="cn-m27-299">Enforce access policies on apps</li>

<li id="cn-m27-300">Perform remote management</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m27-301"><b>SEAndroid</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-302">SEAndroid or Security-Enhanced Android is built upon 
SELinux, which is used to implement Mandatory Access Control (MAC) in a 
Linux system. Using SELinux, SEAndroid performs the same task of 
implementing MAC on the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m27-303">

<li id="cn-m27-303">System services</li>

<li id="cn-m27-304">Applications and their data</li>

<li id="cn-m27-305">System logs</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m27-306">With the use of SELinux in the backend, it can keep 
tight control of the Android environment and therefore, if there is a 
malicious app, it can reduce any kind of malicious impact.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-307">By default, SEAndroid works in the enforcing mode, 
which logs actions that attempted to violate the SELinux policy. These 
actions are then logged to <b>dmesg&nbsp;</b>and&nbsp;<b>logcat</b>. SELinux in SEAndroid works with the denial principle. Anything that is not explicitly allowed is denied by default.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m27-309"><b>Exercise 4 - Enforcement and Monitoring</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m27-310">In an enterprise environment, it is essential to 
monitor mobile devices. One malware-infected mobile device can be the 
reason for a major data breach. There are several methods that mobile 
device users can use to manage and control their own devices. For 
example, a user may simply load an unknown and malicious app onto a 
mobile device. Without having appropriate controls in place, it would be
 difficult for an administrator to control such issues.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-311">In this exercise, you will learn about the enforcement and monitoring of mobile devices.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m27-313">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m27-331">This exercise contains supporting materials for Security+.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-332"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m27-c-4" src="MobileSecuritySolutions_files/image-m27-c-4.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-334"><b>Third-party App Stores</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-335">Whether you are an iPhone or Android phone user, you 
would have downloaded apps from a centralized location known as the app 
store. In an organization, these are considered third-party app stores 
as they reside outside the organization’s network. Depending on the type
 of mobile device or phone users use, they can freely download and 
install the app from their respective app stores. This works fine in the
 personal scenario.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-336">However, it becomes difficult in an organization to 
control such a scenario because the users are also using 
organization-specific apps and data on the same mobile device. A user 
may download a malicious app that can compromise the mobile device, and 
therefore, the organizational data can be tampered with or stolen. To 
resolve this situation, you can use MDM to control the apps installed on
 the mobile device.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-337"><b>Rooting/Jailbreaking</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-338">Every Android and iOS device has certain operating 
system controls limiting its users' capabilities to perform certain 
functions. A user can install, update, or delete apps, but the users 
cannot perform operating system level tweaking or modifications. For 
example, a user cannot unofficially upgrade the operating system or 
undelete files that have been deleted. For such tasks, the user needs to
 have root-level permissions.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-339">Rooting or jailbreaking is removing or bypassing the 
operating system's security controls, which can either be Android or 
iOS. In the Android world, this process is known as rooting. In the iOS 
world, this process is known as jailbreaking. The fundamental concept 
for both remains the same, which is to remove or bypass the security 
controls to gain root-level privileges. However, with MDM, you can block
 rooting or jailbreaking.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-340"><b>Sideloading</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-341">The sideloading method uses an alternate method to 
install apps on Android devices rather than download and install it from
 an authorized app store. A user can use a USB On-the-Go (OTG) method to
 install an app. A USB with an unauthorized app can be plugged into the 
mobile device with either a Type-C or MicroUSB converter.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-342">For example, a user wants a game app, but the app 
store has a limited version. The user finds a full version on the 
Internet, downloads it, and installs it using the USB OTG method. Even 
though this method works fine, there are possibilities that the user may
 end up installing a malicious app.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-343"><b>Custom Firmware</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-344">Each mobile device comes with a firmware that has 
certain functionality. However, you may want to install a custom 
firmware that gives you additional privileges. Even though it cannot be 
confirmed that a custom firmware may work. Even if it works with a 
specific mobile device, several security loopholes can make the mobile 
device vulnerable. Such firmware updates should be stopped with 
applications, such as MDM.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-345"><b>Carrier Unlocking</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-346">Specifically, mobile phones or devices are provided 
by the mobile service provider or the carrier in the United States. 
These devices are in a locked state, which means that they work with a 
SIM from a specific carrier but not with the others. You would typically
 buy a bundled deal in which you get the mobile device along with a SIM 
and connection. If you switch to another carrier, the same mobile device
 does not work.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-347">There is a process of detaching the mobile device 
from the carrier. If you complete the process successfully, the mobile 
device is detached from the service provider, and then you can use SIMs 
from other service providers on the same mobile device.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-348"><b>Firmware Over-the-air (OTA) Updates</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-349">Like any electronic device, such as laptops or 
cameras, mobile devices also have a firmware. When you purchase a mobile
 device, it would have a specific version of the firmware. However, a 
few months later, the vendor may release another firmware that needs to 
be updated on the mobile device. The vendor pushes the update to the 
user’s devices, which is done through an automatic method.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-350">The user may choose to perform this task manually. 
Automatic or manual methods can be configured in the settings of the 
mobile device. OTA refers to cellular updates. OTA cannot be performed 
if you disable mobile data or are not connected to a wireless network.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-351"><b>Camera Use</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-352">Almost all mobile devices are equipped with cameras, 
which can be used to take photos or videos. However, if an organization 
owns the device, it can be a serious concern if the camera is used for 
inappropriate photos or videos that are not legal.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-353">Also, another concern with camera use is that the 
user may use it for personal photos. If the device is managed by MDM and
 is lost, the administrator can simply perform a remote wipe, removing 
personal photos and videos.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-354"><b>Short Message Service (SMS)/Multimedia Message Service (MMS)/Rich Communication Services (RCS)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-355">Since the initial invention of the mobile device, SMS
 has been a part of it. Even today, SMS is still available over a 
cellular network. It is a limited service that allows you to send a 
message of 160 words. You can only send texts in SMS. MMS and RCS are 
advanced versions of SMS. MMS allows you to send photos, audio files, 
and contact files. There is no character limit in MMS, but there is a 
message size limit, which is 300 KB. Unlike SMS, which is a feature 
found in all mobile devices, MMS must be supported by the mobile device.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-356">RCS is an advanced version of MMS. RCS supports 
photos, audio files, videos, location information, emojis. RCS is widely
 used by organizations to share information, such as product delivery 
alerts.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-357">It is wise for organizations to put a policy that stops the misuse of SMS/MMS/RCS.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-358"><b>External Media</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-359">Any external device that can store data is known as 
external media. You can have a camera with limited storage to store 
data, such as pictures. You can have other external devices, such as a 
USB drive, hard drive, or even a smartwatch that can store data. With 
the range of external media available, the users can carry data in and 
out of the organization.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-360">However, when these external devices move the data in
 and out of the organization, there is always a chance of malware being 
brought into the organization. It is difficult to control such devices 
unless you have a centralized solution to monitor the use of such 
devices.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-361"><b>USB On The Go (OTG)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-362">When a mobile device can connect and read data from a
 USB drive without a desktop or laptop, this method is called USB OTG. 
In this method, you directly connect the USB with the device, such as a 
mobile phone, with a microUSB or Type-C port. The USB devices, such as a
 USB drive, have a Type-A or full-size USB connector. Therefore, you 
need either a microUSB or Type-C USB converter. However, it depends on 
the mobile device that you have.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-363">Many USB drives have dual-face, which means a Type-A 
connector, and another side is typically a microUSB connector. These are
 specifically designed to work with mobile devices that have microUSB 
ports.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-364"><b>Recording Microphone</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-365">Several devices now have the capability of using an 
in-built microphone. For example, most of the laptops have in-built 
microphones that can be used for recording conference calls. Even mobile
 devices and smartwatches have the capability of recording 
conversations. In such a scenario, important and critical conversations 
can be recorded without the other party’s knowledge and shared with 
third-parties.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-366"><b>GPS Tagging</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-367">GPS tagging or Geotagging is a method of embedding 
location information into photographs. Several mobile devices have the 
capability of geotagging. When this feature is enabled, it automatically
 embeds the geotagging information into the photograph's metadata. This 
means that anyone who gets their hands on the photograph can find the 
location information. Geotagging feature should be disabled unless it is
 required.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-368"><b>WiFi Direct/Ad Hoc</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-369">The administrator controls infrastructure mode and 
all the traffic that passes through an access point. In the Wi-Fi Direct
 mode, devices can communicate directly with each other without an 
access point. For example, you need to configure a small wireless 
network in which devices can connect and authenticate using a PIN. You 
need to configure Wi-Fi Direct method in this scenario because the 
devices do not need an access point to communicate.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-370">In the ad hoc mode, devices connect in a mesh network
 as a group of peers. In this mode, the devices need an access point to 
communicate with each other.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-371"><b>Tethering</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-372">When you connect your mobile phone to your laptop or 
desktop via a USB cable and share the mobile Internet connection, this 
method is called tethering. The mobile device needs to have USB 
tethering capability.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-373"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m27-c-5" src="MobileSecuritySolutions_files/image-m27-c-5.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 Screenshot of Android"><figcaption>Figure 4.1 Screenshot of Android: Showing the USB tethering option in Android phone settings.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m27-374">When you enable this feature and connect the mobile 
to the laptop via the USB cable, it connects to the Internet. In Windows
 10, you get a Connected status, which is shown as Network.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-375"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m27-c-6" src="MobileSecuritySolutions_files/image-m27-c-6.jpg" alt="Figure 4.2 Screenshot of Windows 10"><figcaption>Figure 4.2 Screenshot of Windows 10: Showing the system connected using the USB tethering option.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-376"><b>Hotspot</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-377">A hotspot is sharing a mobile connection with other 
mobile devices, such as mobile phones and tablets. You can also connect a
 laptop and even a desktop if it has a wireless network adapter. A 
hotspot is generally enabled when you are on the move or do not have any
 other connecting methods to the Internet. Often, you can find hotspots 
in hotels and airports.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-378">It is important to note that when a mobile phone has 
hotspot enabled, its Internet data package is being used. You can 
exhaust the Internet data package by downloading large files. It also 
drains the battery of the mobile phone that has hotspot enabled.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-379">Smartphones have hotspot capability, but you need to 
have an Internet data package to share an Internet connection using a 
hotspot. When you enable a hotspot, you can use various features that 
may be available on your phone. For example, you can limit the number of
 users or even the daily data limit. Other than this, you can also set 
the hotspot to turn off automatically after it is idle for a certain 
time, such as 10 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-381"><b>Payment Methods</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-382">Several users use their mobile devices to make online
 payments. For example, you may be paying electricity bills or 
purchasing on an E-commerce website. However, you should ensure that you
 do not connect to an open or public hotspot when making such a payment.
 The mobile app that you are using should be from a trusted vendor. 
Several small vendors do not perform enough testing on their mobile 
apps, which means that these apps can have vulnerabilities that can be 
exploited. If possible, an external reader should be used to perform 
online transactions through mobile devices.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m27-383"><b>Exercise 5 - Deployment Models</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m27-384">In a dynamically changing IT environment, employees 
cannot be constrained to their workstations and work. Organizations have
 started to expand, and such expansions require employees to move around
 between different offices and meet domestic and international clients. 
Carrying data becomes a necessity.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-385">Organizations have started to allow employees to use 
mobile devices to connect to the organization’s network and carry data. 
However, different organizations follow different models. In this 
exercise, you will learn about different deployment models for mobile 
devices.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m27-387">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m27-388">

<li id="cn-m27-388">Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)</li>

<li id="cn-m27-389">Choose Your Own Device (CYOD)</li>

<li id="cn-m27-390">Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE)</li>

<li id="cn-m27-391">Corporate-Owned, Business Only (COBO)</li>

<li id="cn-m27-392">Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m27-395">This exercise contains supporting materials for Security+.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-396"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m27-c-8" src="MobileSecuritySolutions_files/image-m27-c-8.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-398"><b>Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-399">Organizations might allow you to bring your own 
device for official use. In this deployment model, the employee or the 
user brings the device of their own choice. The organization does not 
mandate a specific device that the employee can use. Also, the 
organization does not maintain any kind of control over the BYOD 
devices.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-400">However, the organizations need to ensure that any 
corporate data on the mobile phone is secure. To safeguard the data, 
mobile phones must be encrypted. Most organizations use MDM to control 
the BYOD devices, which means that the data is encrypted and if the 
device is lost, using MDM, a remote wipe can erase the contents of the 
device.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-401"><b>Choose Your Own Device (CYOD)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-402">In CYOD, the organization allows the employees to 
choose a device from an available list. There are pre-approved devices 
that are part of the list, and the employee must choose from this list. 
The employee can either purchase the device from the organization or pay
 rent. However, the organization has complete control over the mobile 
device, which means that it controls the device and its usage in fully 
locked down mode.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-403"><b>Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-404">The organization provides the mobile device to the 
user. As a user, you can use the device for your reasons. However, the 
device is fully controlled by the organization. Even though the users 
can use the device as they like, it is in a continuously monitored 
state, which means that the organization controls security.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-405">A COPE device is provisioned and configured by the 
organization, but the user can still install more apps and carry their 
data. This means that the COPE devices are not in a fully locked down 
mode.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-406"><b>Corporate-Owned, Business Only (COBO)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-407">In COBO, the organization not only provides the 
device but also controls and manages the devices. The applications and 
the data also belong to the organization. The COBO devices are strictly 
in control of the organizations. Most of the time, the COBO devices are 
configured in a kiosk mode where only certain applications work. The 
COBO device user cannot install or invoke any other application other 
than the allowed ones. The COBO devices are always in a fully locked 
down mode.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m27-408"><b>Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m27-409">A virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) allows users 
to access their virtual desktop environment from their desktops and 
mobile phones. The users can log on from anywhere as long as there is 
connectivity to the VDI environment.  The users will connect to the VDI 
environment from anywhere and get the same desktop, data, and 
applications.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-410">The virtual desktops are stored on centralized 
servers. Users connect to the centralized server using their 
credentials, and the user-specific desktops are displayed. This 
environment works best when the users do not have fixed desktops, such 
as in Business Process Management (BPM). Users can use any system and 
connect to the VPI server and get the same environment.</p>

<p id="cn-m27-411">There are several benefits that an organization gains
 with the implementation of VDI. The first benefit is centralized 
management. Everything, including the virtual desktops, data, and 
applications, is stored on the server. You can patch or manage them in a
 central location. The second benefit is security. The data is stored on
 the centralized server, not on the local systems or devices. If a local
 system or device is compromised, the data is still safe on the server. 
The third benefit is cost-saving as there is a cost of running and 
maintaining the server. The organization does not have to invest in 
buying high-end user devices.</p>

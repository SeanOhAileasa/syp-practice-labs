vulnerabilities are the primary reason for any security breach. For 
example, an Internet-facing application with a critical vulnerability is
 likely to be explored and exploited by a hacker.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-98"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m8-c-1" src="DeterminingSecurityVulnerabilities_files/image-m8-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-99"><b>Cloud-based vs. On-premises Vulnerabilities</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-100">Fundamentally, a cloud infrastructure is identical to 
an on-premise infrastructure except that you do not have physical access
 to the machines. The type of security controls that you can implement 
in an on-premise data centre, you can implement in the cloud as well.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-101">Over the years, an on-premise infrastructure gets worn
 out unless the organization chooses to add new security devices and 
applications. There needs to be continuous upgrades made right to the 
endpoints, servers, applications, and network devices. Without 
continuous upgrades, organizations may have to live with legacy 
infrastructure, mostly not supported by vendors. What this means is when
 there are vulnerabilities, the organizations cannot patch them as there
 is no or little support. This is not the case with cloud services. 
There are continuous upgrades that come with the subscription you take.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-102">Because of physical access in on-premise data centres,
 there are more chances of unauthorized access to the network or data 
centres.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-103">Data privacy may be an issue in the cloud as data is 
not in your control. How data is stored is not transparent to the cloud 
consumer. You can logically assign access to data, but you cannot 
physically control access.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-104">In totality, the cloud service providers tend to keep 
their infrastructure updated and focus on minimal or no vulnerabilities.
 However, when you set up your network in a cloud environment, it is 
your responsibility to keep it updated. Be it the operating systems or 
the applications. You need to secure your network.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-105"><b>Zero-day</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-106">A zero-day attack exploits an unknown vulnerability 
and can only be discovered when new software is deployed. Let’s assume a
 scenario; recently, one of your newly deployed applications was 
attacked and the attacker was able to gain administrative access. The 
antivirus and HIDS deployed on the server hosting the application was 
not able to detect any suspicious files or malware. A zero-day attack is
 impossible to detect as it exploits unknown vulnerabilities.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-107">A zero-day vulnerability is an example of an unknown 
threat. It is not known to an organization, but there is a high 
possibility that it may be present in applications that the organization
 uses. Unknown threats usually occur because attackers continue to find 
new methods to conduct attacks.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-108">Software typically has vulnerabilities, and most 
vulnerabilities are known and patched by the software vendor. However, 
other vulnerabilities are discovered and then exploited (in most cases) 
by different entities, such as security researchers or hackers. The 
vulnerabilities are unknown to anyone, including the software vendors, 
and can be exploited.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-109">It is important to note that because of the single 
reason that the vulnerability is not yet known, a zero-day vulnerability
 is difficult to patch.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-110">Hackers typically lookout for unknown vulnerabilities,
 and when they find it, they exploit it for certain benefits, such as 
unauthorized access to data and systems. Some hackers may ask for a 
reward from the software vendor, and if not paid, they may sell it to 
other entities or exploit it themselves.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-111"><b>Task 1 - Security Updates E-mail Service</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-112">In order to limit the threat of Zero-day exploits, Microsoft runs the <b>Security Updates E-mail Service </b>that
 will automatically send e-mails out to subscribers that outline 
security updates to Microsoft software. There are many reasons as to why
 this is helpful knowledge for a security administrator, although it 
also limits the attack surface with Zero-day threats.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-132"><b>Weak Configurations</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-133">There can be several reasons why an operating system, 
application, or a network appliance can suffer from a weak 
configuration. Often, the vulnerabilities exist in an operating system, 
an application, or even a network device due to weak configurations, 
which can be of different types. Let’s look at some of the key types of 
weak configurations.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m8-134"><b><i>Default Settings</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m8-135">Often an administrator would deploy the default 
configuration of settings in a system, application, or a network device.
 This type of configuration is known as out-of-the-box, which is known 
to be weaker than a customized configuration. The vendors of operating 
systems, applications, and network devices mostly use minimal security 
for the ease of installation. However, it is the responsibility of an 
administrator to tweak the security settings to ensure that the 
operating system, application, or the network device does not suffer 
from weak configurations, which can lead to its compromise.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-136">For example, an administrator may install an operating
 system or configure a wireless access point and leave it with the 
default configuration. Even though they will be secure by default, the 
security will be at a minimal level.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m8-137"><b><i>Open Permissions</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m8-138">Whether your data is stored in an on-premises 
datacenter or the cloud, you would need to provide restrictive 
permissions. However, this does not happen often. Administrators and 
users, knowingly or unknowingly, give open permissions. For example, 
let’s assume that you have a Linux system on which you have several 
confidential files. You simply assign 777 permissions on the file that 
contains confidential information. The 777 permissions provide everyone 
read, write, and execute permissions. The owner of the file should have 
provided only the relevant permissions, such as Read.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m8-139"><b><i>Unsecured Root Accounts</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m8-140">Several administrators allow users to have 
administrative privileges on a system. For example, a user may simply 
log on to a system with the Administrator account. On the other hand, 
the root account may be used to log on. Some administrators do not 
bother to create user accounts in a Linux system and allow users to use 
the root account.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-141">Another reason the root account can be unsecured is by
 using a weak password, which can be easily guessed. This is a typical 
problem that can exist with any operating system, irrespective of what 
type of user accounts are being used. The unsecured root account in a 
Linux system is an open invitation for a threat actor to compromise it.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m8-142"><b><i>Errors</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m8-143">Errors can be of different types, and there can be 
configurational errors in a system, or there can be programming errors. 
Configuration errors can occur when you’ve made a change to the hardware
 or performed a software upgrade.  Suppose an application programmer has
 developed an application with errors, such as not including proper 
authentication functionality in a code, or incorrect validation of 
user’s input. In that case, there is a high chance an attacker will 
exploit these vulnerabilities. Any type of error that a system or 
application may have will introduce vulnerabilities in a system.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-144">A key attack specifically on web applications is <b>Cross</b>-<b>Site Scripting </b>(<b>XSS</b>),
 which is a type of attack where an attacker injects malicious scripts 
into vulnerable web applications, thereby causing serious damage to 
applications. The malicious script is executed in the victim’s web 
browser when they visit an infected page. <b>JavaScript </b>is the most common scripting language used for developing malicious code.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m8-145"><b><i>Weak Encryption</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m8-146">Whenever you are sharing or storing data, it is 
appropriate to use a strong encryption method. In the past, there have 
been various incidents that lead to data compromise due to weak 
encryption.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-147">For example, in a wireless network, <b>Wired Equivalent Privacy </b>(<b>WEP</b>)
 was initially used with wireless networks, but it can be easily cracked
 so it is no longer recommended for use. If you still go ahead and use 
it on your wireless network, then someone even with little hacking 
skills can break it.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-148">Another example is <b>Wi</b>-<b>Fi Protected Access </b>(<b>WPA</b>), which uses the <b>Temporal Key Integrity Protocol </b>(<b>TKIP</b>) - a 128-bit per-packet key. It will encrypt the network transmissions using <b>TKIP</b>, which was considered a replacement to <b>WEP</b>, but it is vulnerable and weaker than its successor, <b>WPA2</b>.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-149">A protocol providing weak encryption uses an 
insufficient length of an encryption key, which can be broken. This was 
the case with <b>WEP </b>and <b>WPA</b>.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m8-150"><b><i>Unsecure Protocols</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m8-151">Organizations often use unsecured protocols that lead 
to several attacks on their infrastructure. Some of the key unsecured 
protocols are <b>HTTP</b>, <b>FTP</b>, <b>Telnet</b>, and <b>SNMP</b>.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-152">Let’s take an example of <b>Telnet</b>, which is used to remotely connect to servers and administer them. <b>Telnet </b>sends
 clear text communication over the network and Internet, depending on 
where you connected with a server. The authentication information is 
also sent in cleartext. Someone with a packet capturing tool can capture
 and gain access to authentication information.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-153"><b>FTP</b>, <b>HTTP</b>, and <b>SNMP v1 </b>and <b>v2 </b>also
 share information in clear text, which makes them equally as prone to 
different types of attacks, such as packet capturing or even a <b>Man</b>-<b>in</b>-<b>the</b>-<b>Middle </b>attack.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-154"><b>Legacy Platforms</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-155">When an operating system or application completes its 
shelf life, it is then succeeded by a newer version. A vendor always 
recommends using the latest and newer version of an operating system and
 platform for several reasons, such as new features, better support for 
newer hardware, and fewer vulnerabilities in most cases.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-156">When an operating system or application goes out of 
the market, its vendor stops its support after a specified time. 
Consider the example of <b>Windows XP </b>and <b>Windows 7 </b>end of support:</p>

<ul id="cn-m8-157">

<li id="cn-m8-157">Windows XP: April 8, 2014</li>

<li id="cn-m8-158">Windows 7: January 14, 2020</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m8-159">When there is no support after a specified time, this 
means that the vendor will also not be rolling out updates or patches 
that can cover known vulnerabilities. If there are vulnerabilities found
 that do not have patches or updates, then these systems are considered 
vulnerable. One vulnerability in such an operating system or application
 can impact the entire network.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-160"><b>Task 2 - Open ports and services</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-161">The <b>Nmap </b>and <b>Netstat </b>Linux commands enable you to discover open ports on a system . Using the <b>Nmap </b>command, you can perform port scanning of a specific system or more than one system on the network. The <b>Netstat </b>command is a network information tool that can provide information about the network connection, routing tables, and much more.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-162">In this task, you will discover open ports on a system.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m8-163"><b><i>Step 1</i></b></h4>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m8-227"><b>Exercise 2 - Third-Party Risks</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m8-228">An organization may have a robust infrastructure, but 
if they are working with third-parties, security risks can increment 
themselves in multi-folds. For example, despite having all security 
controls implemented, malware may trigger a third-party communication 
channel and creep into a network.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-229">In this exercise, you will learn about third-party risks.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m8-231">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m8-232">

<li id="cn-m8-232">Vendor Management</li>

<li id="cn-m8-233">Supply Chain</li>

<li id="cn-m8-234">Outsourced Code Development</li>

<li id="cn-m8-235">Data Storage</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m8-237">This exercise contains supporting materials for Security+.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-238"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m8-c-19" src="DeterminingSecurityVulnerabilities_files/image-m8-c-19.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-239"><b>Vendor Management</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-240">Almost all organizations work with one or more 
vendors. Along with the security of its network, an organization must 
ensure that vendors who are connecting to its network are also secured. 
If the vendor does not implement appropriate security controls, it could
 lead to the collapse of network security.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-241">Take an example of the Target corporation, the famous 
retail chain giant. In November 2013, one of the biggest security 
breaches in history took place. The hackers not only got their hands on 
110 million credit and debit card numbers, but they also managed to 
steal about 11 Gigabytes of data. The attack on Target was not due to 
its own mistake but its vendor, Fazio Mechanical, which was a 
refrigeration contractor.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-242">It all started with the reconnaissance of Target that 
leads to Fazio Mechanical. One of the Fazio employees fell for a 
phishing Email, which made an entry point for the <b>Citadel </b>malware. Fazio was not using a full-fledged anti-malware software, and a free version of his software failed to detect <b>Citadel</b>.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-243">After <b>Citadel </b>was activated and its payload 
released, it gained the credentials of Fazio Mechanical on one of the 
Target’s portals known as Ariba, which was deployed on a server that was
 connected with an internal network. It is believed that a vulnerability
 was exploited, and then hackers were inside the network to get what 
they wanted.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-244"><b>Supply Chain</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-245">A supply chain network for an organization may simply 
introduce multiple entry points for a hacker. Consider the above-given 
example of Target, where Fazio Mechanical was the entry point into 
Target’s network. Vendors, in terms of size and financial capacity, are 
smaller than the organization in most cases. Therefore, the vendors may 
not have a robust and secure infrastructure, which is the focal point 
for hackers.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-246">After hackers attack the supply chain vendor, it is 
much easier to get into the victim organization’s network than attack it
 directly.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-247"><b>Outsourced Code Development</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-248">Organizations outsource several types of work. Code 
development outsourcing is a common practice. However, just like a 
supply chain, the vendors may not have mechanisms and processes to check
 code security. Therefore, they may introduce several security 
vulnerabilities, such as <b>Cross</b>-<b>site Scripting </b>(<b>XSS</b>) or <b>SQL Injection </b>into their codes.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-249">After the code is written, it needs to be sanitized 
and validated, which vendors may choose to skip, not perform it 
correctly, or simply ignore. Since the organization will use the code, 
the vendor may not be directly impacted, but the organization becomes 
vulnerable to several attacks.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-250"><b>Data Storage</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-251">With the cloud revolution in recent times, 
organizations have started to move their infrastructure out of 
on-premise data centers, with applications and storage devices moved to 
the cloud. However, the data stored in the cloud or with a third-party 
has several security issues.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-252">There is always a concern about data privacy. You can 
have strict control and provide limited access to data, but since data 
is not residing with you, you do not have control over it. You cannot be
 sure if someone at the cloud service provider is looking at your data 
or not. Another issue is that the location where your data resides can 
also be prone to malware attacks or other issues like outages or storage
 failure, although failures are noted to be minimal and well 
communicated with larger providers.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-253">Therefore, before you decide to put your data into 
someone’s storage, you need to ensure that the data will remain secure. 
You also need to be aware of security issues.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m8-256"><b>Exercise 3 - Improper or Weak Patch Management</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m8-257">Improper or weak patch management can lead to several 
security risks. Your organization, if not patching systems properly, 
cannot meet certain regulatory compliances, such as ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, 
or HIPAA. It could be your internal policies that you have to adhere to.
 An organization may also not be able to protect its infrastructure from
 cyber-attacks or malware.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-258">In this exercise, you will learn about various types of improper or weak patch management.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m8-260">After completing this exercise, you should be able to:</p>

<p id="cn-m8-262">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m8-263">

<li id="cn-m8-263">Firmware</li>

<li id="cn-m8-264">Operating System (OS)</li>

<h3 id="cn-m8-270"><b>Firmware</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-271">Each device has firmware, code that provides 
instructions to the hardware. Without this, modern devices would be 
impossible to run. Most often, firmware also has vulnerabilities that 
are exploited to the extent that a device, such as a cell phone, can be 
used and controlled by the attacker. Another possibility is that 
existing vulnerabilities in firmware can also be used for privilege 
escalations to gain administrative access.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-272">From time to time, as and when there are 
vulnerabilities discovered or new features  added, vendors provide 
updated firmware through their website. Updating firmware not only 
improves device functionality but also helps to remove existing 
vulnerabilities.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-273"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m8-c-21" src="DeterminingSecurityVulnerabilities_files/image-m8-c-21.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 Screenshot of Dell Website"><figcaption>Figure 3.1 Screenshot of Dell Website: Showing the availability of the firmware for selected laptop models.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-275"><b>Operating System (OS)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-276">Just like firmware, operating system updates are also 
critical. It is a known fact that no application or operating system is 
defect-free, and therefore, there is a need for ongoing patches.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-277">Updates, specifically on Windows devices, can be 
either be manual or automated. In a manual process, the user has to use 
built-in features of <b>Windows 10 </b>to initiate the update. In an automated process, for a single user, <b>Windows Update </b>can be set to automatically download updates. On a network, tools such as the <b>Windows Software Update Service </b>(<b>WSUS</b>) can deploy patches.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-278">A large number of home users ignore updating their operating systems. Each <b>Windows OS </b>has the <b>Windows Update </b>functionality, which automatically detects available updates.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-279"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m8-c-22" src="DeterminingSecurityVulnerabilities_files/image-m8-c-22.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 Screenshot of Windows Update"><figcaption>Figure 3.2 Screenshot of Windows Update: Showing the availability of updates to be downloaded and installed.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m8-281">Ignoring updates will leave the vulnerabilities open, which can be exploited. For example, <b>Windows 10 </b>has several known vulnerabilities that need to be patched. Some of the key vulnerabilities are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m8-282">

<li id="cn-m8-282">Windows 10 Mount Manager Vulnerability (CVE-2015-1769, MS15-085)</li>

<li id="cn-m8-283">Microsoft Edge Vulnerabilities (MS15-091)</li>

<li id="cn-m8-284">Microsoft Graphics Component Vulnerabilities (MS15-080)</li>

<li id="cn-m8-285">Internet Explorer Vulnerabilities (MS15-079)</li>

<li id="cn-m8-286">Microsoft Windows Journal Vulnerability (MS15-098)</li>

<li id="cn-m8-287">Win32k Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (CVE-2015-0057)</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m8-288">Most of these vulnerabilities, if exploited, are prone
 to privilege escalation. Microsoft has released patches for each of 
these vulnerabilities. However, it is the user’s responsibility to 
deploy them.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-289"><b>Applications</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-290">Operating systems may not be directly exposed on the 
Internet, but applications are. If there are vulnerabilities that have 
not been patched, then they can be in danger. A mistake often made by 
administrators is to patch an operating system but not applications. If 
an open vulnerability in an application is exploited, it could lead to 
various types of attacks, such as privilege escalation on the operating 
system.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-291"><b>WSUS </b>does not cover third-party applications, 
and therefore, you may have to go with another solution, which can not 
only patch the operating system, applications, but a breadth of 
applications that your organization is using.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-292"><b>Task 1 - Analyze Hosts on a Network using Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-293"><b>Microsoft Baseline Analyzer </b>(MBSA) is one of 
the products you can use in the Windows environment to scan for missing 
updates and patches. It is no longer supported on <b>Windows 10 </b>and the latest versions of Windows Server. In this task, <b>Microsoft Baseline Analyzer </b>will analyze hosts on the network to determine if updates need to be applied.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-324">There can be several impacts of the attacks on an 
individual or an organization. The impacts can be similar in nature, but
 the magnitude of the attacks can differ for an organization when you 
compare it with an individual.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-325">For example, data loss for an individual can be 
devastating. However, its impact on an organization is usually much 
larger. The data belonging to an organization has a larger worth than 
the data for an individual.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-326">In this exercise, you will learn about the impacts of an attack.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-339"><b>Data Loss</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-340"><b>Data Loss </b>occurs when you lose data either by 
losing a device, or the storage of a device becomes non-functional or 
corrupt. For example, let’s assume you have critical data stored on a 
USB drive. While traveling to your office, you lose the USB drive. 
Another example can be of a system that contains several gigabytes of 
data and its hard drive crashes. You are unable to recover data from the
 hard drive, and there is no backup. This is also data loss.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-341">You may forget your removable device such as a 
smartphone somewhere, or it may get stolen. Alternatively, removable 
media may crash, or a USB drive may stop working after the user 
accidentally drops it. In such situations, data loss occurs if you do 
not have copies of the data elsewhere.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-342">It is important to note that any type of unintentional or intentional data deletion may also be considered as data loss.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-343">Data theft, on the other hand, occurs when someone 
steals your data. This can be done by planting malware on your system 
and stealing the data in the background. Data theft can also occur 
during data transmission. When you transfer data over an unencrypted 
channel, you can face data theft as the hacker can intercept the data.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-344">Data loss can occur due to various reasons. For 
example, server failure, human error, or it could be intentional. 
Usually, the loss cannot be compensated or recovered. Imagine an 
organization that has confidential files that were deleted by a human 
error. If there is no backup of the confidential files, the organization
 is at significant risk of losing its business.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-346"><b>Data Breaches</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-347">A data breach is one of the biggest threats in cloud 
computing. In a data breach, confidential, critical, or personal data is
 stolen or accessed by an unauthorized entity. Data such as user 
credentials, credit card details, social security numbers, and medical 
data may be accessed. It can occur with the data stored in the data 
center or the cloud servers. Even though cloud service providers 
implement security methods to safeguard the data, these methods may not 
be enough.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-348">A data breach may occur due to stealing or cracking a 
user’s password, exploiting a security flaw, or even exploiting a 
misconfiguration in the cloud servers.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-349"><b>Data Exfiltration</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-350">Someone owns every piece of data. It could be an 
individual or an organization. The person who owns data must permit 
someone to copy or transfer the data from one place to another or from 
one system to another. However, when data copying, transfer, or even 
access to data takes place without the permission of the owner, it is 
known as data exfiltration.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-351">Let’s take the example of an organization that has 
several confidential documents. If either an insider or an external 
entity gains access to these documents from permissions, it is data 
exfiltration.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-352">The process of data exfiltration can either be manual 
or automated. In a manual process, a threat actor needs to physically 
access the system to copy or move the data. In the automated process, it
 is typically done using malware.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-353"><b>Identity Theft</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-354">Identify theft is a method of using someone’s identity
 for a malicious purpose or financial gain. It is a common practice to 
provide your identity for various purposes, such as to get a credit card
 or to get a passport. However, a threat actor gets access to personal 
information, including your name, address, and phone number, although it
 could be any information used to identify an individual. Threat actors 
could replicate this information to carry out identity theft.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-355">For example, if someone forges your signatures on a 
cheque to withdraw cash, it is identity theft. This method of identity 
theft has been in practice for decades. In modern times however, you are
 most vulnerable to identity theft when you are on the internet, and 
identity theft is considered to be one of the most common threats that 
exist online. It is a common practice for a threat actor to make a fake 
account in the name of your friend to gain access to your personal 
information on a social network. Another method is that someone can 
simply create an account on your name and order several items for which 
you have to pay cash. <b>Zeus </b>is malware that monitors your online 
activities, record keystrokes and captures user credentials, which can 
then be used for identity theft.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-356"><b>Financial</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-357">A security attack can either be on an individual or an
 organization. Both can be the target of financial gains for hackers. 
For example, you have stored your credit card details on a file on your 
system. A hacker, after attacking your system, can access this file. 
After getting the credit card information, the hacker can use it on the 
Internet. You will end up with financial losses in this scenario.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-358">An organization, after the attack, may lose 
confidential and proprietary information. After it is known publicly 
that the organization was under attack, it might lose business from 
customers, which can be translated as financial losses.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-359">Consider another example of a hacker stealing a new 
product design from your organization. The product was unique and was to
 be the first one of its kind in the market. After the hacker sells this
 design to a competitor, your organization will end up losing the 
advantage of being first in the market. Instead, your competitor will 
gain this advantage. In the end, you lose business, which can be 
considered as financial loss.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-360"><b>Reputation</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-361">Often, it is not just an attack on an organization. 
The attack has many severe consequences for an organization, such as 
reputation loss. Not only has the organization suffered a breach, but it
 has also lost its credibility in the market (especially when victim to 
the above financial loss vulnerability).</p>

<p id="cn-m8-362">Imagine a scenario in which an organization has its 
intellectual property stolen in a security attack. The organization will
 not only have a loss of reputation but can also face legal 
implications. Therefore, an organization needs to protect its data.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m8-363"><b>Availability loss</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m8-364">Availability loss way to make the device or data 
unavailable for you to use. This can be done through different methods. 
It could be someone takes the ownership of your data and denies you 
access. It could also be that malware (in this case, known as 
ransomware) encrypts your mobile device and makes your data 
inaccessible. You have to pay a ransom to get your mobile device 
decrypted by the threat actor. Even then, there is no guarantee that 
they will decrypt it. An example of this is the <b>WannaCry </b>virus, 
which in 2017, infected multiple areas of the UK’s National Health 
System, which resulted in a huge loss of confidential data and money.</p>

<p id="cn-m8-365">Availability loss can also be with the applications and servers. For example, if someone launches a <b>Distributed Denial of Service </b>(<b>DDoS</b>)
 attack against a webserver, its web applications will eventually be 
inaccessible to legit users, which can be classified as availability 
loss.</p>

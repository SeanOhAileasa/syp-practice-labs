<h2>CompTIA Security+ Practice Labs</h2>
<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m4-122"><b>Exercise 1 - Load Balancing</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m4-123">Consider a scenario in which you are attempting to 
access a Web application on your internal network. The response time is 
slow. Based on your request, when the administrator investigates this 
issue, he finds that the server does not have optimal resources. For the
 administrator, it is not possible to add more resources to the server.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-124">There are two options: either you migrate the 
application to another server or add an additional server to share the 
workload. The latter solution is recommended. You can configure load 
balancing between both the servers so that when a request comes in, the 
load balancer decides which server the request can be sent to.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-125">When a load balancer is used, the users no longer 
directly connect with the servers. They connect with the load balancer 
between the users and the servers. When requests are received, it sends 
the request to the appropriate server based on the load being shared 
between the servers. With the load balancer, no server gets overwhelmed 
with requests. There is an equal distribution of requests between the 
server by the load balancer.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-126">Load balancers can either be hardware or 
software-based. Hardware-based load balancers are dedicated devices that
 serve only the purpose of load balancing between servers. 
Software-based load balancers are applications that run on an operating 
system.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-127">In this exercise, you will learn about load balancing and load balancers.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m4-129">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m4-136">This exercise contains supporting materials for Security+.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-137"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m4-c-1" src="ImplementingSecureNetworkSolutions_files/image-m4-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-139"><b>Active/Active</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-140">A load balancer can be configured in different ways. 
In the Active/Active configuration, there are two or more load balancers
 that work together. All the load balancers are configured to serve the 
requests that are received. When a user sends a request to a Webserver 
with an active/active load balancer in front, one of the load balancers 
receives the request from the Webserver and responds to the user. If the
 user re-visits the same Webpage, the load balancer, which served the 
previous request, does not go back to the Webserver but retrieves the 
same Webpage from the cache. Using this method, there is less impact on 
network bandwidth.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-141">However, if the same load balancer handling the 
requests goes down, the user’s request for the same Webpage is no longer
 available, and the user may receive an error. The load balancer may go 
down due to a hardware or software failure. For example, if there is a 
service failure, the load balancer may not be able to handle requests 
for the Web server. In this case, the users are likely to get errors 
rather than responses to their requests.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-142"><b>Active/Passive </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-143">In an Active/Passive configuration, one load balancer 
handles all the requests, and the second one is the standby node. The 
primary load balancer handles the requests and distributes them to the 
servers running in the backend. The entire load is handled on the load 
balancer. The passive load balancer is in monitoring mode. It monitors 
the primary load balancer. If there is an issue with the primary load 
balancer’s performance or a failure, then the passive load balancer 
immediately takes over without any downtime.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-144">One of the key advantages of the Active/Passive load 
balancer configuration is that there is no downtime as the passive load 
balancer continuously monitors the Active load balancer.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-145"><b>Scheduling </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-146">Load balancers use different types of scheduling methods, which are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-147">

<li id="cn-m4-147"><b>Affinity</b>: This method distributes the load to 
servers depending on their capacity to handle requests. This process of 
distributing the load is known as affinity scheduling, which can also be
 based on the number of connections a load balancer has. For example, 
the load balancer with a minimum number of connections may get the next 
request.</li>

<li id="cn-m4-148"><b>Round-robin</b>: With a round-robin, the requests 
are cyclically distributed to the servers. For example, let’s assume 
that there are three Web servers configured with the load balancer. When
 the first request comes, the load balancer sends it to the first 
server. Then, the second request is sent to the second server. In the 
same manner, the third request is sent to the third server. When the 
fourth request is received, it will be sent to the first server.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m4-149"><b>Virtual IP </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-150">When the servers are configured with a load balancer, 
you do not need to connect to it individually. There would be one 
virtual IP assigned to the load balancer and one name, and the users can
 use either one. The virtual IP is the IP address assigned to the load 
balancer configuration that the users will connect to. It is like a 
normal IP address except that it is assigned to the load balancer 
configuration, unlike being assigned to a physical network adapter. For 
example, you have two Web servers that are connected to the load 
balancer. The following IP addresses are assigned:</p>

<p id="cn-m4-151">Web server 1: 192.168.0.5</p>

<p id="cn-m4-152">Web server 2: 192.168.0.6</p>

<p id="cn-m4-153">The virtual IP that is assigned to the load balancer 
configuration can be 192.168.0.100. The users no longer connect to 
192.168.0.5 or 192.168.0.6. They connect to the virtual IP, which is 
192.168.0.100. The load balancer can then automatically route the 
requests to the appropriate Web server.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-154">The load balancer then directs the requests to the appropriate available server.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-155"><b>Persistence </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-156">A load balancer can also provide session persistence. 
When a client sends a request, the load balancer can assign an attribute
 to the user, which could be a cookie or track the user’s IP address. 
The load balancer creates a session stickiness or session persistence 
between the user and the server. During the entire session, the load 
balancer then starts sending the user requests to one specific server 
rather than distributing it to different servers.</p>

<h2>CompTIA Security+ Practice Labs</h2>
<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m4-159"><b>Exercise 2 - Network Segmentation</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m4-160">Networks tend to grow large and become difficult to 
manage. There are several reasons that the network should be broken into
 pieces known as segments. Once the network is broken into segments, not
 only will it increase the manageability, but will also increase the 
performance by reducing broadcast traffic of the smaller network 
sections</p>

<p id="cn-m4-161">In this exercise, you will learn about various terminologies related to network segmentation.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m4-163">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-164">

<li id="cn-m4-164">Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)</li>

<li id="cn-m4-165">Intranet</li>

<li id="cn-m4-166">Extranet</li>

<li id="cn-m4-167">Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)</li>

<li id="cn-m4-168">East-West Traffic</li>

<li id="cn-m4-169">Zero Trust</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m4-171">This exercise contains supporting materials for Security+.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-172"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m4-c-2" src="ImplementingSecureNetworkSolutions_files/image-m4-c-2.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-174"><b>Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-175">Virtual LANs can divide a network into multiple 
broadcast domains without the use of routers. When you divide a larger 
network into smaller sections or broadcast domains, it increases the 
manageability. It is also possible to apply restrictions on these 
smaller sections. For example, you can block the traffic from one VLAN 
to another. If the network is compromised, the attack can be isolated 
using these segments</p>

<p id="cn-m4-176">Another great advantage of VLAN is that you can reduce
 direct communication between the systems. When the systems are placed 
in different VLANs, communication is needed between these devices, the 
traffic has to pass through the gateway of the VLAN, which ensures that 
the network traffic is inspected.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-177"><b>Intranet</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-178">The Intranet is the internal network of an 
organization. Intranet is available only to the employees of an 
organization in most cases. However, some organizations may allow 
visiting vendors and contractors to connect to their Intranet. The key 
purpose of the Intranet is to share resources, such as files and 
folders. You can also have an internal Web application that serves a 
specific business goal.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-179">For example, you may have an internally developed 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application where the employees mark 
their attendance, create and manage projects, and also have their 
profile, which is then linked to the HR database.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-180"><b>Extranet </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-181">In this network topology, an organization makes 
resources available through the internet, such as a web server, without 
giving access to the organization's internal network. The other 
organization can be a vendor or partner to the organization. It could 
also be a client which would need access to specific resources, for 
example, placing orders through a purchasing application</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-182"><b>Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-183">A network typically has endpoints, servers, and 
network devices. The servers are mostly Internet-facing and provide 
access to external users, such as clients and vendors. When you need to 
secure the endpoints, if any server gets compromised, you need to 
segregate the endpoints and the servers.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-184">A DMZ is a logically separated network from the 
internal network. It contains servers that need to be accessible 
externally through the internet. For example, Web or messaging servers 
that need to be externally accessible. The other servers of the network 
can be placed on the internal network and do not need to be accessible 
externally; for example, a database server</p>

<p id="cn-m4-185">The DMZ network is Internet-facing, but network 
communication between the internal and the DMZ needs to be encrypted. 
The network traffic flowing between the DMZ and the internal network is 
controlled with firewalls between both networks.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-186">For example, you have a Web application that has a 
database as a backend. You want to ensure that the database should be 
secured even if someone compromises the Webserver. In such a scenario, 
the database server should remain on the internal network so that if the
 Web server, which is in the DMZ network, is compromised, the database 
server is still secure.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-187"><b>East-West Traffic </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-188">Datacenters contain several different types of devices
 that need to communicate with each other, for example, physical and 
virtual servers, containers, and micro-services architecture. The 
communication and the traffic flowing from one container to another or 
from one virtual machine to another is known as East-West traffic.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-189">Data centers are equipped with several security 
appliances and applications to protect the perimeter network. For 
example, the data centers may consist of firewalls and next-generation 
firewalls that can be used to protect the network perimeter from attacks
 like, Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service attacks 
(DDoS). The internet-facing applications can be protected with a Web 
Application Firewall (WAF). However, all this traffic is vertically 
flowing traffic and is considered to be North-South traffic.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-190">However, with the use of containers, micro-services, 
and virtual machines, there is a continuous increase in East-West 
traffic, which is prone to insider attacks. It could be an intentional 
insider attack, or it could simply be unintentional. For example, a user
 connects his laptop, which is malware-infected, to the local network. 
The malware will likely propagate itself to the internal network and, 
therefore, infect the systems. There need to be security controls that 
not only protect the internal systems’ traffic but also monitor it. You 
can have antimalware and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) or even an Intrusion
 Prevention System (IPS) in place to monitor the systems and East-West 
traffic.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-193"><b>Zero Trust </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-194">The Zero trust concept in networking is based on the 
methodology that all requests received from any device on the network, 
regardless if it is internally or externally located, must always be 
authenticated and authorized. A no trust policy and always authorize and
 authenticate needs to be implemented to ensure the security of devices 
and data. A further security implementation will be the segmentation of 
the network, ensuring the prevention of lateral movement.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-198">A VPN allows a user to connect to a specific network, 
such as your organization’s network, using an unsecured external network
 on the internet. A VPN server allows roaming users to connect to the 
organization’s internal network. When a user uses an unsecured network 
to connect to the organization’s network, an encrypted channel is 
created, securing the data during transmission.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-199">In this exercise, you will learn about VPN and the different types.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m4-201">After completing this exercise, you should have further knowledge of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-202">

<li id="cn-m4-202">Always On</li>

<li id="cn-m4-203">Split Tunnel vs. Full Tunnel</li>

<li id="cn-m4-204">Remote Access vs. Site-to-site</li>

<h3 id="cn-m4-212"><b>Always On</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-213">A VPN allows the user to always stay connected instead
 of connecting and disconnecting from it. Once the user connects to the 
VPN, it is connected persistently. The connection is established 
automatically as the user connects the system to the Internet. For 
example, Windows 10 has an Always On VPN, which connects the user to a 
VPN server without user intervention. The only time user intervention is
 required is when multi-factor authentication is enabled for VPN access.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-216"><b>Split Tunnel vs. Full Tunnel </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-217">With a full tunnel VPN connection, all the network 
traffic is routed through the enterprise network, for example, if a user
 is connected to the full tunnel VPN and visits a specific website, the 
enterprise network handles the internet traffic. This type of VPN 
connection is more secure but is more resource-intensive.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-218">In a Split tunnel VPN connection, the external network
 traffic is not routed through the enterprise network but is handled 
externally, which removes the load of network traffic from the 
enterprise network.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-219"><b>Remote Access vs. Site-to-site </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-220">A remote-access VPN connection ensures that users 
working remotely can access internal network resources when connected to
 the VPN.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-221">A site-to-site VPN connection is created when a 
company has different branches, and these branches need to access 
resources from each other. Two VPN gateways need to be created at each 
branch to ensure connectivity.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-222"><b>IPSec</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-223">IPSec is a set of protocols that are used to create 
encrypted connections between networking devices. The data that is sent 
across the external network is encrypted and secure if malicious threat 
actors intercept it.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-224"><b>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-225">SSL is a protocol that is now replaced by the TLS 
protocol. SSL was mainly used to secure the information between two 
endpoints. For example, SSL was primarily used between a Webserver and a
 client that was trying to access a Webpage. TLS is an upgraded version 
of SSL and provides improved security. When a website is configured with
 an SSL/TLS certificate, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) 
is used to encrypt the network traffic from the website.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-228"><b>HTML5</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-229">A VPN connection can be of two types. The first one is
 that you use a client application that is installed on your system. The
 second type is the clientless connection, which is done through HTML 5 
VPN portal. You need to access the HTML 5 VPN portal address through a 
web browser and authenticate using a username and password.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-230">After you log on to the HTML 5 VPN portal, you can access the internal network resources.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-231"><b>Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-232">The L2TP protocol is a tunneling protocol that is used
 to create a VPN connection. It is normally used in conjunction with 
IPSec to secure the encrypt the network traffic.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-237">Switches have ports that are used for connecting the 
systems and network devices. It is essential to protect the ports from 
being exploited. Most Layer 2 switches and higher versions have port 
security features.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-238">In this exercise, you will learn about port security methods.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m4-247">You will be using the following devices in this lab. Please power these on now.</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-248">

<li id="cn-m4-248"><b>PLABDC01 </b>- Windows Server 2019 (Domain Controller)</li>

<li id="cn-m4-249"><b>PLABWIN10 </b>- Windows 10 (Domain Member Workstation)</li>

<p id="cn-m4-250"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m4-c-7" src="ImplementingSecureNetworkSolutions_files/image-m4-c-7.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-251"><b>Broadcast Storm Prevention / Loop Prevention</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-252">Loop prevention is a method to prevent a broadcast 
storm on the network. A broadcast storm occurs when a switch sends 
packets to another switch, which in turn sends the packets to a third 
switch looking for the target system. The third system floods the 
packets back to the first and second switches, which again floods them 
back to each other. This causes a broadcast storm, which eventually 
floods the network with unnecessary traffic. To prevent a broadcast 
storm, the loop prevention method needs to be implemented.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-253">The loop prevention method uses the spanning-tree 
algorithm (STA). A switch can have multiple routes to send or receive 
communication to a host on the network. STA is used to determine the 
best route for the network traffic. The quickest route is used for 
communication. However, if the primary route is not available, other 
routes can be utilized for sending communication to the target host.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-254"><b>Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) Guard</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-255">A bridge protocol data unit (BPDU) is a data message 
that is utilized by the switches on the network. A BPDU message contains
 various information, which includes information such as ports, their 
priorities, and addresses. The use of the BPDU message is to detect 
loops in the network.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-256">The BPDU messages are used to configure and manage the
 Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) topology. Enabling the BDPU Guard feature 
ensures that the device will not receive BDPU messages from its 
connected devices, thus protecting the STP configuration.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-257"><b>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Snooping</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-258">The DHCP Snooping feature is available in several 
switches. The core intent of enabling the DHCP Snooping feature is to 
prevent rogue DHCP servers from being implemented on the network. When 
you configure the DHCP Snooping feature, the switch creates and 
maintains a DHCP Snooping table, which tracks untrusted messages on the 
network. The table also maintains the IP addresses that are leased from 
the DHCP servers and assigned to the various ports on the switch. The 
switch also tracks the untrusted ports, and if there are messages 
received on the untrusted ports, then the messages are dropped based on 
the source MAC addresses if it does not match the entries in the table.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-262"><b>Task 1 - Media Access Control (MAC) Filtering </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-263">Each network device has a MAC address, a globally unique hardware number embedded within the device.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-264">Configuring MAC address filtering is a method to ensure only legitimate devices can connect to the wireless network.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-265">To perform MAC address filtering, perform the following steps:</p>

<p id="cn-m4-315">A network can have a variety of services, servers, and
 network devices. To ensure the optimum security of a network, each of 
them needs to be secured. For example, having a firewall does not 
automatically ensure that your network is safe. You need to configure 
the firewall with proper rules. Similarly, you may have several services
 running on the network. You need to ensure that each service has a fair
 amount of resources to be visible to the end-users.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-341"><b>Jump Servers &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-342">A jump server or a jump host is a hardened and secure 
system or device that connects two dissimilar security zones. It can 
connect your internal network with a highly secure network. To be able 
to connect to the secure network, you need to navigate through the jump 
server. For example, a jump box is configured between the DMZ and the 
office network. It is the only entry point to the DMZ.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-346"><b>Proxy Servers&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-347">A proxy server is a device or application that acts as
 an agent on a user’s request, specifically on the Internet. When a user
 attempts to access a Website, a proxy server would simply go and fetch 
the URL and return it to the user. In this way, the user does not have 
to be directly connected to the Internet.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-348">There are different roles a proxy server can play. Some of the key roles are:</p>

<p id="cn-m4-349"><b>Application proxy</b>: An application proxy is also
 known as an application-layer firewall. It inspects the packet 
components, such as the header and data portion of the packet.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-350"><b>Transparent proxy</b>: A transparent proxy does not
 require any additional software to be installed at the client end.  You
 need to configure the default gateway IP address to point to the proxy 
server.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-351"><b>Circuit-level proxy</b>: A Circuit-level proxy 
operates at Layer 5, which is the session layer of the OSI model. SOCKS 
firewall is a type of Circuit-level proxy.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-352"><b>Forward proxy</b>: With the forward proxy, all 
requests to the Internet are sent through a proxy server. A user first 
needs to connect to the proxy server, which first checks its cache for 
the same web pages that the user is trying to access. If the web pages 
are of the latest version, they are returned to the user. However, if 
the web pages are either outdated or not in the cache, the proxy server 
fetches the user's web pages.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-353"><b>Reverse proxy</b>: A reverse proxy works in just 
the opposite manner of forwarding proxy. It receives a request from the 
internet or any external network and forwards it to the relevant 
internal server or system. To the external world, the proxy is the 
visible server but not the internal system.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-354"><b>Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)/Network-Based Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-355">NIDS is designed to monitor network traffic. It is 
important to know that NIDS is not capable of preventing an attack. It 
can only detect the attack. On the other hand, NIPS can monitor, detect,
 and protect a network against suspicious and malicious traffic. NIPS is
 usually situated between the network and the edge firewall.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-356">There are different types of NIDS/NIPS:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-357"><b><i>Signature-based</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-358">Signature-based IDS or IPS strictly work with the 
signatures, which must be updated regularly. Each signature has a 
specific pattern, which identifies a particular threat. If any pattern 
is found in the signatures, then it is considered to be a threat. IDS or
 IPS works similarly to an antivirus, which is also dependent on 
malicious software signatures. If these signatures are not regularly 
updated, new malicious threats might not be detected while monitoring 
the network traffic with IDS and IPS utilities.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-359"><b><i>Behavior-based</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-360">Behavior-based IDS or IPS continue to monitor the 
behavior of the processes and programs. If there is a change in the 
behavior of any process or program, an alert is generated.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-361"><b><i>Heuristic-based</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-362">Heuristic-based IDS or IPS uses an algorithm to scan 
applications, network traffic, and programs. Based on the algorithm, it 
can determine whether something, such as traffic, is malicious or not. 
It actively monitors the programs and network traffic to determine if it
 is malicious or not.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-363"><b><i>Anomaly-based</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-364">Anomaly-based IDS can detect any traffic that is new 
or unusual. It can also help in detecting any potential network hardware
 exploits. Once installed, it needs to gather network traffic 
information to create a baseline of the traffic. Once the baseline is 
developed, any deviation from it will raise an alarm. It is important to
 note that network traffic patterns may vary from time to time. For 
example, the addition of a new web application server. If baselines are 
not updated after any new additions, a high number of false positives 
may be generated.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-365"><b><i>Inline vs. passive</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-366">An IDS can be of two types: inline or passive. The 
inline IDS is connected to the network and monitors the traffic in 
real-time. As the data flows on the network, the inline IDS monitors the
 data. A passive IDS works oppositely to an inline IDS. It is connected 
to a switch responsible for providing a copy of the traffic to the 
passive IDS.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-367"><b>Hardware Security Module (HSM)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-368">A&nbsp;hardware security module&nbsp;(HSM) is a 
security device used for safeguarding and managing digital keys, which 
are used for strong authentication. HSM can be in the form of a plug-in 
card or an external device.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-369">The following are the functions of an HSM:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-370">

<li id="cn-m4-370">Performing encryption and decryption</li>

<li id="cn-m4-371">Manage secure key generation</li>

<li id="cn-m4-372">Perform secure key storage</li>

<li id="cn-m4-373">Manage Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) keys for databases</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m4-374">The following cryptographic algorithms are supported with HSM:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-375">

<li id="cn-m4-375">AES</li>

<li id="cn-m4-376">RSA</li>

<li id="cn-m4-377">SHA-1</li>

<li id="cn-m4-378">Triple DES</li>

<li id="cn-m4-379">Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m4-380">Other than these cryptographic algorithms, SHA-256 is also supported by HSM.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-381">Let’s take the example of a Web server that you have. 
The Web server is configured to run a website with a certificate. You 
notice that after the certificate configuration, the webserver has 
slowed down. You want the webserver to give good performance while using
 the certificate, and at the same time, you also want to protect its 
private key.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-382">HSM can meet both the requirements mentioned in the 
scenario. HSM increases the performance of the Web server by offloading 
the cryptographic functions. Moreover, HSM stores the private key. There
 are different varieties of HSM available, such as USB and PCIe cards.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-383"><b><i>HSM Functions</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-384">HSM can perform various functions, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-385">

<li id="cn-m4-385">encryption keys management</li>

<li id="cn-m4-386">key exchange</li>

<li id="cn-m4-387">encryption and decryption</li>

<li id="cn-m4-388">cryptographic functions offloading from servers</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m4-389">HSM can be embedded in different types of hardware. Some of the key examples are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-390">

<li id="cn-m4-390">FIPS 140-3 compliant rack-mount chassis</li>

<li id="cn-m4-391">PCI-E cards</li>

<li id="cn-m4-392">USB drives</li>

<li id="cn-m4-393">MicroSD cards</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m4-394"><b><i>Types of HSM</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-395">There are typically three types of HSM:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-396">

<li id="cn-m4-396"><b>Hardware</b>: are available in the form of a device, such as PCI-E cards or MicroSD cards</li>

<li id="cn-m4-397"><b>Virtual</b>: the virtual key manager, which can be
 downloaded from a software vendor’s Website. They can be FIPS 140-2 
compliant but not validated as there is no physical hardware involved.</li>

<li id="cn-m4-398"><b>Hosted</b>: are available in the cloud 
environment. They perform the same functions to generate and protect 
keys. It provides the same level of security in the cloud environment as
 a hardware HSM in the local environment.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m4-399"><b><i>Sensors</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-400">There are a variety of tasks that can be performed 
with the network traffic. Various components help you achieve these 
tasks. For example, a sensor helps you monitor the traffic. However, its
 location for placement is critical for monitoring the traffic. For 
example, a sensor can be placed in a manner that would be able to 
monitor only one system’s traffic. Sensors are typically used with the 
NIDS and NIPS.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-401"><b><i>Collectors</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-402">Collectors are responsible for collecting data from 
the sensors. The collectors would typically be used with the Security 
information and event management (SIEM) systems. The collectors are 
responsible for collecting and bringing in the information to a SIEM.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-403"><b><i>Aggregators</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-404">Aggregators are responsible for putting the data into a
 common repository. They are typically used with SIEM, where the 
information from various network devices and servers is collated. They 
aggregate the events to find the correlation between them.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-405"><b>Firewalls&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-406">In the simplest term, a firewall, either 
software-based or hardware-based, is responsible for monitoring and 
controlling the ingress and egress traffic from a network. In most 
cases, the firewalls are installed on the edge of a network and also 
configured as a gateway for the ingress and egress traffic.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-407">There are several different types of firewalls. Some of the key ones are:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-408"><b><i>Web Application Firewall (WAF)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-409">Several organizations protect Web applications with a 
Web Application Firewall (WAF). Hardening is a process of reducing the 
attack surface for the attackers on a system or application. In the 
application hardening, you can perform various activities like patching 
the application, removing unused features, and closing unnecessary 
ports. You can also deploy certain security controls, such as Web 
Application Firewall (WAF) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) if you use a
 web application. WAF is designed to prevent an application from 
Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks. WAF works at OSI 
Layer 7, protecting HTTP and HTTPS traffic.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-410">It can perform the following tasks:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-411">

<li id="cn-m4-411">Works with HTTP and HTTPS</li>

<li id="cn-m4-412">Blocks attacks and perform deep packet inspection</li>

<li id="cn-m4-413">Provides security at Layer 7 of the OSI model</li>

<li id="cn-m4-414">Protects the application against the XSS, SQL Injection, and various application attacks</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m4-415"><b><i>Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-416">NGFW is an advanced version of a traditional firewall,
 mainly designed to perform port and protocol inspection. NGFW has more 
capabilities, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-417">

<li id="cn-m4-417">Deep packet inspection</li>

<li id="cn-m4-418">SSL/SSH inspection</li>

<li id="cn-m4-419">Geolocation</li>

<li id="cn-m4-420">Sandboxing</li>

<li id="cn-m4-421">Web Application Firewall (WAF)</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m4-422">There are several products out in the market that have
 most of these features. Some NGFW may also have a reverse proxy, URL 
filtering, and IDS/IPS built-in. An example of NGFW is Untangle.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-423"><b><i>Stateful</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-424">A stateful firewall has the capability of inspecting 
the packets, whether they are fragmented or not. It can also block 
unauthorized traffic from entering the network. It also allows access 
only to specific ports with the respective protocols. A stateful 
firewall uses the active sessions to perform packet inspection.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-425"><b><i>Stateless</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-426">Stateless firewalls are ACL-based, which watch for the
 network to act on the source or destination addresses. They make packet
 filtering decisions based on the packet headers. A stateless firewall 
cannot inspect the traffic patterns.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-427"><b><i>Unified Threat Management (UTM)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-428">UTM or Unified Threat Management, also known as Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW), can perform the functions of:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-429">

<li id="cn-m4-429">Firewall</li>

<li id="cn-m4-430">Anti-spam</li>

<li id="cn-m4-431">Content filtering</li>

<li id="cn-m4-432">Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</li>

<li id="cn-m4-433">Malware scanner</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m4-434"><b><i>Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-435">When you need to connect a private network to a public
 network, you can use the NAT gateway, which uses a single IP address. 
The private network behind the NAT Gateway is not exposed to the 
Internet. The servers and systems on the private network can still 
access the Internet, but they are not exposed. Only the IP address of 
the NAT Gateway is exposed to the Internet. It is one way you can 
safeguard your private network. The servers or other network devices on 
the Internet cannot directly connect to the private network.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-436"><b><i>Content/URL Filter</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-437">A content filter is used to prevent user access to 
certain applications, such as executables. In addition to firewalls and 
antivirus, content filtering devices, IPS, and sandboxing are examples 
of active security appliances.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-438">URL filters will restrict access to certain sites when
 using a proxy server. URL filtering allows or denies access to specific
 Website URLs that are contained within a defined list. Using a URL 
filter can block sites based on the type of content.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-439"><b><i>Open-source vs. Proprietary</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-440">A firewall can either be open-source or proprietary. 
When you refer to a proprietary firewall, it is a software or a hardware
 firewall that a vendor sells. There is a price tag attached to the 
firewall. When you refer to a software firewall, the vendor may offer a 
free version with limited features and a full version with all the 
features. For example, in most free version firewalls, you may not get 
updates or real-time monitoring. Such features are bundled with the full
 version.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-441">Some of the key proprietary firewalls are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-442">

<li id="cn-m4-442">Cisco ASA</li>

<li id="cn-m4-443">WatchGuard</li>

<li id="cn-m4-444">Fortinet FortiGate</li>

<li id="cn-m4-445">SonicWall TZ</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m4-446">Open-source firewalls do not have a price tag. 
However, this does not mean that open-source firewalls lack features. 
Most of the open-source firewalls are full of features that you get in 
commercial firewalls. Some of the key open-source firewalls are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-447">

<li id="cn-m4-447">PFSense</li>

<li id="cn-m4-448">ClearOSFirewall</li>

<li id="cn-m4-449">Endian Firewall Community (EFC)</li>

<li id="cn-m4-450">IPFire</li>

<li id="cn-m4-451">NetDeep Secure</li>

<li id="cn-m4-452">Untangle</li>

<li id="cn-m4-453">Glasswire</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m4-454"><b><i>Hardware vs. Software</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-455">A firewall can either be hardware or software-based. A
 hardware firewall is a hardware device that acts as a firewall. It is 
equipped with all firewall features. Compared to a software firewall, a 
hardware firewall is expansive and may require specific expertise to 
configure it.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-456"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m4-c-20" src="ImplementingSecureNetworkSolutions_files/image-m4-c-20.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2 Image of a Paloalto PA-220 firewall: Showing an example of a hardware firewall appliance."><figcaption>Figure 5.2 Image of a Paloalto PA-220 firewall: Showing an example of a hardware firewall appliance.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m4-458">A software firewall is either an independent application or built-in to the operating system. For example, <b>Windows Defender Firewall </b>is part of the Windows operating system. It is a full-fledged firewall in itself.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-459"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m4-c-21" src="ImplementingSecureNetworkSolutions_files/image-m4-c-21.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3 Screenshot of Software Firewall: Showing the Windows Firewall in Windows 10."><figcaption>Figure 5.3 Screenshot of Software Firewall: Showing the Windows Firewall in Windows 10.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m4-461">An example of an independent software firewall is <b>GlassWire</b>. It not only monitors the system, but also detects unwanted changes in the system.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-462"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m4-c-22" src="ImplementingSecureNetworkSolutions_files/image-m4-c-22.jpg" alt="Figure 5.4 Screenshot of Software Firewall: Showing the interface of the GlassWire software firewall."><figcaption>Figure 5.4 Screenshot of Software Firewall: Showing the interface of the GlassWire software firewall.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m4-464">When compared to a hardware firewall, the software 
firewall is dependent on the underlying operating system. Therefore, it 
does consume system resources, which can impact the operating system's 
performance. The hardware firewall, on the other hand, is an independent
 device. Even if there is a system that is compromised, the hardware 
firewall is not impacted.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-465"><b><i>Appliance vs. Host-based vs. Virtual</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-466">A host-based firewall is dedicated to a particular 
host. For example, Windows Defender Firewall is a host-based firewall, 
which can protect the operating system on which it is running. If you 
are looking to protect only a single system, a host-based firewall is 
the solution. An attacker can circumvent host-based firewalls if the 
system is compromised. The attacker can simply switch off the host-based
 firewall.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-467">An appliance-based firewall is a hardware device that 
is placed in the network to monitor and manage incoming and outgoing 
traffic. Even if systems on the network are compromised, it is still not
 easy for the attacker to circumvent the appliance-based firewall. Most 
appliance-based firewalls come with several other features, such as IPS,
 VPN, and gateway.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-468">Like software or hardware firewalls, a virtual 
firewall is also meant to monitor and filter traffic. However, it is 
mainly designed to work with a virtual environment that consists of 
virtual machines. There are one or more policies that are defined to 
filter the traffic. The firewall monitors any traffic that is moving 
from one virtual machine to another. If the traffic meets a given 
condition, it is allowed, or else it is dropped.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-469"><b>Route Security</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-470">When information travels over a network or through the
 Internet, there is a set of routes that are used. Routes determine how 
the information can reach its target.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-471">On a network, a router is responsible for learning and
 sending the packets on a specific route. Even though there may be 
several routes available, the router tends to choose the most 
appropriate path. If the router itself is compromised, the attacker can 
feed false routes to send the information on a different path 
altogether.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-472">For a router to send information, it needs peers. It 
develops peering relationships or neighboring adjacency to send the 
information. There can be a possibility that the attacker may break the 
neighboring adjacency, which can be done by multiple methods, such as 
exhausting the router resources or by forming saturated queues.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-473">To ensure route security, several methods can be used. Some of the key methods are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-474">

<li id="cn-m4-474">Perform neighbor authentication, which is a feature 
available in most routing protocols. When neighbor authentication is 
enabled, the router receives information only from trusted neighbors. 
Any type of route information from an untrusted neighbor is then 
ignored.</li>

<li id="cn-m4-475">Disable dynamic peer discovery, which allows the 
router to discover new neighbors. It is always better to manually 
configure the trusted neighbors. This will prevent any bogus neighbor 
from sharing updates with the router.</li>

<li id="cn-m4-476">Set the interfaces as passive using a 
passive-interface command on the interfaces on which you do not want the
 router adjacencies. This will prevent any automatic router adjacencies 
on these interfaces.</li>

<li id="cn-m4-477">Use Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists 
(ACLs) to permit only legitimate traffic from authorized devices on the 
network.</li>

<li id="cn-m4-478">Configure route filtering on the routers to ensure 
only the required networks receive the routing information. The networks
 that are not supposed to receive the traffic will not have the routing 
information broadcast.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m4-479">These are only some of the methods that can be used. 
Other methods, such as Peer Prefix Filtering, Prefix List, Distribute 
List, and Maximum Prefix Filtering methods, can also be used.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-480"><b>Quality of Service (QoS)&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-481">Quality of Service or QoS is a set of priorities that 
are defined for network traffic. A specific type of traffic, such as 
video traffic, can be prioritized over other types. QoS becomes 
important for traffic that uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Video and 
voice traffic are examples of traffic that use the UDP protocol.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-482">Consider an example of a voice call over the network. 
If there is no QoS, then the voice traffic is not given any priority. 
Due to this, the voice quality, due to network congestion, may become 
unclear. The user on the receiving end may not be able to hear or 
understand what is being said. QoS is to be used with UDP-based traffic 
because the UDP protocol cannot retransmit the lost packets. If there is
 network congestion, the packets may get dropped or lost during the 
communication.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-483">When QoS is in place, voice and video traffic are 
given high priority over data traffic, which uses the TCP protocol. 
Unlike UDP, the TCP protocol can retransmit the lost packets and 
assemble the packets in the correct order to reassemble the data files. 
Therefore, QoS is an essential need for UDP-based traffic.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-484"><b>Implications of IPv6</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-485">It is a known fact that the IPv4 addresses are running
 out. Hence, a new upgraded version known as IPv6 was released. IPv6 has
 a much larger addressing space, which offers trillions of IP addresses.
 Despite several other benefits, there are some implications of IPv6. 
Some of the key implications are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-486">

<li id="cn-m4-486">Networks need to be upgraded or redesigned. If the 
existing network architectures were designed according to the IPv4 
schema, they may or may not support IPv6.</li>

<li id="cn-m4-487">Devices and operating systems need to be upgraded. An
 organization may be using an older version of an operating system or an
 older network device. If they do not support IPv6, then they need to 
either be replaced or upgraded.</li>

<li id="cn-m4-488">The overall network architecture is complex. Devices and applications may require a new architecture to accommodate IPv6.</li>

<li id="cn-m4-489">IPv6 addresses are long and difficult to remember. 
You could memorize an IPv4 address and add them to any application or 
system. However, it is difficult to remember an IPv6 address because of 
its length and combination of letters and numbers.</li>

<li id="cn-m4-490">The adoption of IPv6 is still missing with many 
organizations. If you completely moved your organization to IPv6, you 
have to have dual-stack hosts to send the IPv6 packets to IPv4 hosts. If
 dual-stack hosts are not there, then IPv6 cannot communicate with IPv4.</li>

<li id="cn-m4-491">There are security concerns when using relay routers 
to convert IPv6 to IPv4 to communicate with the systems that still work 
with IPv4. The relay routers cannot determine the IPv4 address as it is 
encapsulated with the IPv6 address.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m4-492"><b>Port Spanning/Port Mirroring&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-493">Port mirroring is also known as Switch Port Analyzer 
(SPAN). A switch has a dedicated port used to mirror the traffic from 
one port and then send the mirrored copy of the traffic to another port.
 The mirrored copy of the traffic is used for monitoring. There can be 
various reasons due to which you need to monitor the network traffic. 
Some of the key reasons are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-494">

<li id="cn-m4-494">Analyzing the traffic patterns over the network</li>

<li id="cn-m4-495">Detecting intrusions on the network</li>

<li id="cn-m4-496">Adhering to compliance</li>

<li id="cn-m4-497">Co-relating events</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m4-498">Port mirroring can be configured on the Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-499"><b><i>Port Taps</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m4-500">Alternate to port mirroring, you can also use a 
special device for mirroring data. It is a passive device that is placed
 on the network to capture the data from a specific port. Port taps are 
easy to install, and once installed, you do not need to do anything. It 
mirrors the received and sent traffic in real-time.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-501"><b>Monitoring Services</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-502">Network devices need to be monitored continuously. 
Along with the devices, you also need to keep an eye on the network 
traffic. There are various tools available that you can use to monitor 
the network and its devices. Some of the key tools are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-503">

<li id="cn-m4-503">WhatsUp Gold 2017</li>

<li id="cn-m4-504">Nagios XI</li>

<li id="cn-m4-505">Zabbix</li>

<li id="cn-m4-506">Incinga</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m4-507"><b>File Integrity Monitors&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-508">Each operating system has several types of files. It 
can have DLL, executable, logs, text, and other system files that are 
required for the operating system to function. Similar to the operating 
system, various applications also have such files that the applications 
use. All these files are considered configuration files, which must 
remain intact for the operating system and applications to run.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-510">After an attacker compromised a system, they may alter
 some of the configuration files. Such alteration is difficult to detect
 if you do not have file integrity monitoring enabled. When you install a
 file integrity monitoring tool on your system, an agent keeps track of 
the configuration files that are available on the system. It first 
calculates the hashes or checksum of each of the files and stores them 
in the database. If there is an unauthorized change in any of the 
monitored files, then the hash changes, which the agent then tracks.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-511">The agent works in real-time and tracks all these 
files. As a change in any of the monitored files is detected, it 
triggers an alarm. The agent monitors the files for modification, 
deletion, permission changes, or files being copied.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-512"><b>Task 1 - Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-513">ACLs can be configured in four different ways, which are as follows:</p>

<ul id="cn-m4-514">

<li id="cn-m4-514">Per-user basis</li>

<li id="cn-m4-515">Per group basis</li>

<li id="cn-m4-516">Using an effective right mask</li>

<li id="cn-m4-517">For users other than the ones in the group for a file</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m4-518">In this task, you will learn to implement the access control list. To do this, perform the following steps:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m4-519"><b><i>Step 1</i></b></h4>

<h3 id="cn-m4-625"><b>DNS</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-626">You can secure the DNS server by adding a set of 
extensions, known as DNSSec, ensuring that the DNS information is not 
altered during transmission.</p>

<span class="cn-quote" id="cn-m4-627"><b><i>Note: </i></b><i>DNSSec is covered in detail in another module.</i></span>

<h3 id="cn-m4-628"><b>Network Access Control (NAC)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-629">Consider that you manage a large enterprise network. 
Almost 50 percent of the users are mobile, either on the client site or 
working from home. Recently, one user connected to the network and 
infected the system. You want to be able to prevent this from 
reoccurring. You also want to ensure that the host health check is 
performed for the latest antivirus and security patches. The system 
should be updated if they have missing updates and should be allowed 
access to the network only if they are found to be updated. To implement
 these requirements, you need to use NAC, which can evaluate each remote
 device when they attempt to connect to the network. It can perform a 
host health check, and if any deviation is found, it will prevent the 
host from connecting to the network.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-630">NAC can be deployed in different forms. It can be an 
agent-based NAC. You need to configure the NAC agent on the user’s 
system. Based on the NAC policies, if the system is compliant, then the 
system should be allowed access to the network.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-631">In a Windows environment, you can also use an 
agentless NAC. To be able to do this, you need to use Windows Group 
Policies. When a system connects to the domain, Group Policies can 
ensure the devices are checked for compliancy.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-632">You can also use a dissolvable agent that runs once on
 the system and then, based on the NAC policies, allows or denies access
 to the user system. After that, the agent is removed from the system.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-633">Rule-based NAC allows users to connect based on pre-defined conditions.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m4-634"><b>Out-of-band Management</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m4-635">Out-of-band management is a method that allows you to 
manage network devices without compromising security. You establish a 
separate connection from the normal network on which all of the 
organization’s communication occurs. It is a completely different 
connection that helps you to connect to a network device. For example, 
if you have an edge router, it is not best practice to manage the 
network on a default interface. You should rather manage the router 
using a custom configured interface.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-636">Out-of-band management is extensively used for 
emergency access. For example, if the network connectivity is not 
present or the network has gone down, you can use the management 
interface to connect and perform maintenance.</p>

<p id="cn-m4-637">One of the good features of out-of-band management is 
that you can manage the device even if it is powered off. You can 
perform various other tasks, such as upgrading the firmware, 
reinstalling the operating system, or even rebooting or power on the 
network device.</p>

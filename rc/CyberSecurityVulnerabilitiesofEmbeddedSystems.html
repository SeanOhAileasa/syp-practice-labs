<p id="cn-m21-67">In todayâ€™s world, you are likely to be interacting 
with one or more specialized technologies. Examples of specialized 
technologies include mobile devices, embedded systems, Internet of 
Things (IoT), or even Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA). 
Each of these technologies is designed to serve a specific purpose.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-68">However, most of these technologies are complex. There
 may be millions of lines of code running to enable the different 
components to implement the technology. A large codebase is bound to 
introduce vulnerabilities.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-69">In this exercise, you will learn about the vulnerabilities and security implications of embedded and specialized systems.</p>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m21-86">This exercise contains supporting materials for Security+.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-87"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m21-c-1" src="CyberSecurityVulnerabilitiesofEmbeddedSystems_files/image-m21-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-88"><b>Embedded System</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-89">Embedded systems are devices that contain a central 
processing unit (CPU) of their own. This CPU runs an operating system 
and some applications to perform certain specialized functions. Examples
 of embedded systems include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-90">

<li id="cn-m21-90">Automatic Teller Machine (ATM)</li>

<li id="cn-m21-91">Printers</li>

<li id="cn-m21-92">Digital watches</li>

<li id="cn-m21-93">Digital cameras</li>

<li id="cn-m21-94">Automobiles</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-95">If an embedded system connects to the Internet, it becomes an IoT device.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-96">An embedded system can have the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-97">

<li id="cn-m21-97">An overload of tasks may cause scheduling problems</li>

<li id="cn-m21-98">Can be attacked as there is no built-in security</li>

<li id="cn-m21-99">Prone to power drain attack in which the battery of the device is drained out</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m21-100"><b><i>Raspberry Pi and Arduino</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m21-101">Raspberry Pi and Arduino are small electronic-boards 
used to automate certain tasks or even configure home automation. Both 
these boards are prone to attacks, such as password attack, 
man-in-the-middle attack, ARP cache poisoning, Cross Site Scripting 
(XSS), and Sniffing.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-102">Vulnerabilities can be due to these boards or even 
the devices or the communication protocols of the devices. For example, 
if these boards are automated to use Near Field Communication (NFC) for 
unlocking a door, the attacker can break this system and have access to 
the door.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-103">You may also develop or use a Web interface to manage
 your devices through these boards. The Web interface can also be prone 
to attacks if not secured properly. Moreover, a device interacting with 
another device or server on the Internet might attract hackers and 
malware.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m21-104"><b><i>Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m21-105">An FPGA is a programmable chip that does not have any
 pre-programmed functions, unlike many other chips. It can be programmed
 as required. When FPGA needs to be used, it needs to be first 
programmed and configured as per need. For example, any chip that you 
find in a system or any device has a pre-defined function. If you take 
out that chip, the device can no longer perform that function. FPGA can 
be programmed to function as any chip that you find in a device or 
system.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-106">When you program an FPGA chip, you can allow 
multi-user access to it. However, this opens the door for the attackers 
to conduct side-channel attacks. In this type of attack, the attackers 
use the FPGAâ€™s energy consumption to break the encryption.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-108"><b>System Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)/Industrial Control System (ICS)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-109">Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) 
systems are known as the industrial control systems (ICS). These systems
 acquire data from specified points in an industrial process and use it 
to control the industrial process and machinery.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-110">An example of SCADA systems application is the energy
 domain, where SCADA systems manage electricity distribution over a 
large geographical area.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-111">SCADA systems present inherent vulnerabilities that 
have been exploited, and SCADA systems have been attacked multiple times
 across the world. Common vulnerabilities of SCADA systems include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-112">

<li id="cn-m21-112"><b>Unmonitored systems</b>: SCADA systems are 
typically unmonitored. There is no active or continuous monitoring for 
suspicious activities. This makes it difficult to detect an attack when 
it takes place.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-113"><b>Passwords</b>: SCADA systems have built-in 
authentication to enable configuration and modification. However, human 
negligence towards protection measures can lead to compromise of the 
systems. For example, system administrators might use simple passwords 
or share passwords, leading to system security issues.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-114"><b>Poor updates management</b>: SCADA systems need 
to be updated with the latest firmware and software from time to time. 
However, missing updates or inherent vulnerabilities in the updates can 
prove to be an open-door for the attackers.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-115"><b>Inadequate input validation</b>: SCADA systems 
may need some user inputs. SCADA systems should be built to validate 
these inputs thoroughly. Insufficient validation can allow attackers to 
execute arbitrary code. For example, an earlier version of the 
open-architecture WebAccess/SCADA system from Advantech did not validate
 the user input and was compromised.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-116">Components of a SCADA system that can be a target for the attacker:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-117">

<li id="cn-m21-117"><b>Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs): </b>SCADA system
 uses these interfaces to present data to the users after collecting it 
from various sensors. If not secured properly, they can be a target for 
the attackers.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-118"><b>Mobile and Web Applications: </b>SCADA systems 
can be accessed using a mobile device or a Web application. The 
attackers can exploit any vulnerabilities in the accessed devices.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-119"><b>Protocols: </b>SCADA systems use various 
protocols, such as Modbus and Profinet. These protocols lack a strong 
security mechanism. Data traveling over these protocols can be 
intercepted and altered by malicious players.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m21-120"><b>Internet of Things (IoT)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-121">An IoT device is hardware that can collect data and 
communicate the data to other devices over the Internet. Each IoT device
 has an IP address that can be used for communication as well as remote 
monitoring and controlling. In other words, anything that uses a sensor 
and has the capability of autonomous computing can be assigned an IP 
address and configured as a smart device.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-122">Sensors used by IoT devices include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-123">

<li id="cn-m21-123">Temperature</li>

<li id="cn-m21-124">Humidity</li>

<li id="cn-m21-125">Acceleration</li>

<li id="cn-m21-126">Gyro</li>

<li id="cn-m21-127">Accelerometers</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-128">For example, if you add a sensor and computing 
capability to a refrigerator, it becomes a smart device that can be 
networked as an IoT device.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-129">Another example of IoT devices is wearable devices, 
such as activity trackers or pedometers built into watches. A pedometer 
fitted watch informs you about the steps walked in a day, week, or 
month. They can share or send this data to a remote server, mostly in 
the cloud, set up by a manufacturer.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-130">At present, IoT devices are being used for automation
 across various industries, such as consumer electronics, travel, 
energy, healthcare, agriculture, facilities, and security. For example, 
several housing societies and office complexes use smart lighting. These
 lights go dim when the footfall is low and brighten up when the 
footfall is heavy. This is an example of facility automation that uses 
sensors to detect the footfall and is smart enough to respond according 
to the data captured.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-131">The increased use of IoT devices has increased the 
risks of their inherent vulnerabilities. Open Web Application Security 
Project (OWASP) has listed the following top 10 vulnerabilities for IoT:</p>

<p id="cn-m21-132"><b>1. Weak, Guessable, or Hardcoded Passwords</b></p>

<p id="cn-m21-133">The IoT devices can have hardcoded passwords or can 
run on default passwords. Default passwords are normally weak, as well 
as guessable. These passwords can be brute-forced and provide a backdoor
 entry into the IoT devices.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-134"><b>2. Insecure Network Services </b></p>

<p id="cn-m21-135">IoT devices use insecure network services that are 
exposed to the Internet. This leaves a wide room for compromise of 
integrity, confidentiality, availability, and privacy of the exchanged 
information.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-136"><b>3. Insecure Ecosystem Interfaces</b></p>

<p id="cn-m21-137">Insecure interfaces, such as Application Programming 
Interfaces (APIs) that do not use secure encryption methods or 
authentication, can be easily exploited to compromise the information.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-138"><b>4. Lack of Secure Update Mechanism </b></p>

<p id="cn-m21-139">IoT devices frequently receive firmware and software 
updates. These updates must be secure and must be validated before 
installation. This security setting is missing for the IoT devices. 
Moreover, there is no method to rollback any unsuitable update 
installed.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-140"><b>5. Use of Insecure or Outdated Components</b></p>

<p id="cn-m21-141">The IoT devices suffer from the use of insecure or 
outdated components, including the operating system and the software 
running. Insecure or outdated components have vulnerabilities that can 
be easily exploited.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-142"><b>6. Inadequate Privacy Protection </b></p>

<p id="cn-m21-143">The personal information collected by the IoT is open
 to unauthorized access because the information is exchanged with other 
devices without user permission.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-144"><b>7. Insecure Data Transfer and Storage </b></p>

<p id="cn-m21-145">The userâ€™s data is not encrypted when it is in 
storage or transmission. This leaves the information unguarded if the 
device is hacked or the transmission route is compromised.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-146"><b>8. Lack of Device Management </b></p>

<p id="cn-m21-147">IoTs do not have a defined device management routine 
or secure method of commissioning or decommissioning of devices. This 
leaves the network of devices open to unauthorized devices connecting 
in.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-148"><b>9. Insecure Default Settings </b></p>

<p id="cn-m21-149">Most of the IoT devices are shipped with insecure 
default settings. Moreover, some of these devices do not provide a 
method to change the default configuration. Therefore, users might use 
the IoT devices with the insecure default configuration.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-150"><b>10. Lack of Physical Hardening </b></p>

<p id="cn-m21-151">Unlike a system or a laptop, there is hardly any 
physical hardening of the IoT devices. This allows an attacker to 
exploit a vulnerability and control the devices remotely.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-152"><b>Specialized</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-153">With the advancement of technology, specialized 
systems have made their place in everyoneâ€™s day-to-day lives. Examples 
are medical equipment, airplanes, smart meters, or even automatic 
vehicles. With the increasing use of these systems, the security issues 
and vulnerabilities relevant to these systems can impact everyday life 
in a big way. It is also a fact that all hardware devices, be it small 
or large, need to be managed and maintained using an application.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-154">Letâ€™s look at some of the security issues and vulnerabilities with these specialized systems.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m21-155"><b><i>Medical Systems</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m21-156">Just like any other system, medical systems have security issues and vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-157">

<li id="cn-m21-157">Medical and other hospital staff has access to these
 systems. This implies widespread access and hence a greater potential 
of information leak.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-158">Medical equipment might share the network with 
hospital systems. Therefore, any malware or phishing attacks on hospital
 systems might affect the medical systems as well.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-159">With several vendors working with the hospitals, 
several entry points into the hospital network may be opened. These 
entry points are not always closed or safeguarded properly.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-160">Another major security issue is the use of mobile 
devices connected to the hospital network. Several medical facilities 
allow their employees to connect their mobile phones to the network. 
However, an unsecured mobile can always let the malware enter the 
network.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-161">A mobile device with saved hospital network logins 
and confidential information might get stolen or lost. If these mobiles 
are not protected properly, then someone can leverage this information.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-162">One of the major security issues is the online 
connectivity of medical equipment and devices. If they are connected to 
the Internet, then hackers may attempt to break in. The applications 
used to manage the medical equipment might be prone to security flaws, 
such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m21-163"><b><i>Vehicles </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m21-164">Vehicles these days are equipped with several digital
 features, such as USB, GPS, and Bluetooth. Hackers can exploit the 
security vulnerabilities related to these digital features to attack a 
vehicle. As a result, the more the digital features in a vehicle, the 
more susceptible it is to such attacks. For example, if the hacker 
breaks into the vehicleâ€™s GPS, it may add rogue navigation points and 
maps.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-165">Moreover, every vehicle has chips and embedded 
applications. If these applications are not patched, then they can also 
be exploited.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m21-166"><b><i>Aircraft</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m21-167">Unlike any other industry, say Energy and E-commerce,
 a cyberattack on the Aviation industry or an aircraft can be 
devastating. A system failure or exploitation of an unpatched 
vulnerability can cost hundreds of lives.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-168">Systems used in the Aviation industry are complex and
 process real-time data. For example, consider the radar application 
that tracks the real-time location of the aircraft. If vulnerabilities 
in this application are exploited, it can lead to severe consequences.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m21-169"><b><i>Smart Meters</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m21-170">Consider an electricity meter. A traditional meter 
could only monitor electricity consumption. With advancements in 
technology, these meters are evolving as smart meters that monitor 
electricity consumption and share it with the supplier. This means that 
the smart meter acts as an access point to the supplierâ€™s network.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-171">When you install a smart meter, it uses its 
hard-coded credentials to connect to the supplierâ€™s network. If the 
credentials are valid, then an encryption key is sent to the smart 
meter. If a smart meter is hacked, hackers can get the hard-coded 
credentials from the smart meter. They can then get their hands on the 
encryption key and thereby get into the supplierâ€™s network.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-172">If even one of these meters is hacked, it can impact 
the entire network. One such incident happened in Puerto Rico, where 
hackers took control of the installed smart meters, which eventually 
malfunctioned and failed to record the correct electricity utilization.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-174"><b>Voice Over IP (VoIP)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-175">Voice over IP or VoIP is used for making calls using 
the Internet. VoIP, as it mainly uses the Internet, inherits several 
vulnerabilities from the Internet. For example, just like a web 
application, VoIP is also prone to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. 
Other common vulnerabilities in VoIP include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-176">

<li id="cn-m21-176">If using unencrypted connections, someone can eavesdrop on the conversations taking between two or more people.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-177">If there is an attack on the network through which VoIP is connected, it can disrupt the VoIP functionality.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-178">VoIP requires the use of VoIP phones. In most cases, these phones are used with default settings that can be exploited.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-179">VoIP conversations are saved as files, which, if not protected properly, can be stolen and misused.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-180">VoIP is prone to SPIT, which is SPAM over the 
Telephony. An attacker can use different numbers to make numerous calls 
to the target number to prevent it from getting legitimate calls.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m21-181"><b>Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning (HVAC)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-182">The building automation systems are automation 
methods that manage the buildingâ€™s heating, ventilation and air 
conditioning (HVAC). These systems are designed to increase efficiency 
in managing HVAC, reduce cost, and reduce human dependency. Components 
of a building automation system include sensors, controllers, output 
devices, communication protocols, and terminal interface. Each component
 is controlled either by firmware or software.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-183">Building automation systems are prone to 
vulnerabilities similar to other automation or software systems. For 
example, most of the building automation system vulnerabilities are 
common with Web applications. This is because the building automation 
systems are commonly managed by a Web application or a mobile app.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-184">Common vulnerabilities afflicting building automation systems include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-185">

<li id="cn-m21-185">Buffer overflow</li>

<li id="cn-m21-186">Hardcoded secrets</li>

<li id="cn-m21-187">Device misconfigurations</li>

<li id="cn-m21-188">Cross-site scripting</li>

<li id="cn-m21-189">Path traversal</li>

<li id="cn-m21-190">Arbitrary file deletion</li>

<li id="cn-m21-191">Authentication bypass</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m21-193"><b>Drones</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-194">A drone is an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) that is 
remotely controlled through sensors and GPS. It is a small aerial 
vehicle that is used for various purposes, such as surveillance.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-195">A drone works with two different signals: rising and 
downlink signals. The drone receives rising signals. The rising signals 
can be in the form of radio command or GPS signals. An attacker can 
replace the rising signal with lure signals, thereby take control of the
 drone.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-196">The drone sends downlink signals to communicate back 
with the controller. The signals may contain the flight information or 
data transmission, both of which can be intercepted by an attacker.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-197">Neither the downlink nor the rising signals are encrypted, making the drone susceptible to compromise.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-198"><b>Autonomous Vehicles </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-199">An autonomous vehicle, also known as a driverless 
vehicle, is a self-driven vehicle that does not require any human 
intervention. These vehicles run on millions of code lines, typically 
300 million for a vehicle, which makes it nearly impossible to be 
bug-free. More the code lines, the higher the possibility of introducing
 bugs and security flaws, which can be exploited.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-200">Moreover, in some cases, a smartphone app is used to 
control the autonomous vehicle. The app itself can add several security 
vulnerabilities. For example, the attackers may exploit a vulnerability 
in the smartphone app that is controlling the vehicle.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-201">Components in autonomous vehicles that can be exploited include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-202">

<li id="cn-m21-202">Global Positioning System (GPS)</li>

<li id="cn-m21-203">External Networks, such as V2X Network</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-204">Possible attacks on an autonomous vehicle include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-205">

<li id="cn-m21-205">Onboard diagnostics attack</li>

<li id="cn-m21-206">Engine Control Unit (ECU) Firmware tampering attack</li>

<li id="cn-m21-207">Rogue Updates</li>

<li id="cn-m21-208">Physical access to the ECU</li>

<li id="cn-m21-209">Remote access</li>

</ul>

<ol id="cn-m21-210">

</ol>

<h3 id="cn-m21-211"><b>Multifunction Printer (MFP)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-212">Multifunction Printers or MFPâ€™s are printers equipped
 with multiple capabilities including scanning, copying, and printing. 
Some MFPs also have fax capabilities. Printers are usually not 
considered a possible target for hackers. However, several types of 
printers, including MFPs, have been found with vulnerabilities 
including:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-213">

<li id="cn-m21-213">Buffer overflow</li>

<li id="cn-m21-214">Information disclosure</li>

<li id="cn-m21-215">Cross-site scripting (XSS)</li>

<li id="cn-m21-216">Cross-site Request Forgery</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-217">The enterprise-grade MFPs have large storage that is 
used to store documents for printing. When decommissioning these MFPs, 
the storage needs to be wiped out. However, organizations do not 
consider an MFP an attack target and ignore wiping out the storage 
containing confidential information.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-218">The mitre.org website, which contains a vulnerabilities database, has several vulnerabilities listed for MFPs.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-220"><b>Real-time Operating System (RTOS)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-221">A Real-Time Operating System (<b>RTOS</b>) supports 
real-time applications that require instant results to their requests. 
Certain applications cannot use the buffer to store their requests for 
later. They need instant responses. Such applications are designed to 
work with the RTOS, which immediately processes the data without 
buffering the requests. Examples of such applications include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-222">

<li id="cn-m21-222">Air Traffic Control&nbsp;Systems</li>

<li id="cn-m21-223">Networked Multimedia&nbsp;Systems</li>

<li id="cn-m21-224">Command Control&nbsp;Systems</li>

<li id="cn-m21-225">Military systems</li>

<li id="cn-m21-226">Automobiles</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-227">Just like any other system, RTOS is prone to vulnerabilities including:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-228">

<li id="cn-m21-228">Remote code execution</li>

<li id="cn-m21-229">Insecure permissions</li>

<li id="cn-m21-230">Privilege escalation</li>

<li id="cn-m21-231">Denial of Service (DoS)</li>

<li id="cn-m21-232">Buffer overflow</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-233">Most of these vulnerabilities can cause information leakage within RTOS.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-234"><b>Surveillance Systems</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-235">Surveillance systems, such as CCTV cameras, are 
usually installed to safeguard physical access to premises and devices. 
While safeguarding the physical access, these systems might introduce 
software vulnerabilities of their own that can lead to network attacks. 
For example, an organization has IP-based cameras connected to the local
 network. Exploiting any vulnerability in the CCTV camera can provide 
the attacker a foothold into the network. In this case, the cameras work
 as a backdoor for the attacker.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-236">To ensure that surveillance systems do not become the soft spot for a network attacker, be cautious about:</p>

<p id="cn-m21-237">1. Are there any vulnerabilities in the surveillance systems, which can be exploited?</p>

<p id="cn-m21-238">2. If yes, what is the impact of such exploitation?</p>

<h3 id="cn-m21-239"><b>System-on-Chip (SoC)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m21-240">A&nbsp;System-on-Chip (SoC), as the name suggests, is
 a complete system on an integrated circuit (IC), which includes various
 chips and circuitry. These are required for the system to function. 
Normally, SoC would include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-241">

<li id="cn-m21-241">CPU</li>

<li id="cn-m21-242">Input and output ports</li>

<li id="cn-m21-243">Memory</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-244">Examples of SOC are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-245">

<li id="cn-m21-245">Smartphones</li>

<li id="cn-m21-246">Cameras</li>

<li id="cn-m21-247">Tablets</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m21-248">An SoC might be vulnerable to:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-249">

<li id="cn-m21-249">Information leakage</li>

<li id="cn-m21-250">Physical tampering</li>

<li id="cn-m21-251">Side-channel attacks</li>

<li id="cn-m21-252">Reverse engineering</li>

<li id="cn-m21-253">Buffer issues</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m21-254"><b>Constraints</b></h3>

<h4 id="cn-m21-255"><b><i>Crypto</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m21-256">Several cryptographic algorithms exist. Some of them 
have proven their weaknesses and have been broken, and others continue 
to be secure. When implementing cryptographic algorithms, keep the 
following constraints in mind:</p>

<ul id="cn-m21-257">

<li id="cn-m21-257">Do not implement an algorithm only because it is easy to implement. Select an algorithm based on its strength.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-258">It is advisable not to attempt to invent your algorithm. Numerous industry-proven algorithms are available.</li>

<li id="cn-m21-259">Cryptographic algorithms can secure the data or the application only if implemented properly.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m21-260"><b><i>Inability to Patch</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m21-261">There can be several constraints in patching live 
systems and applications. To patch them, you might need to take them 
offline, which can be a loss of revenue for the organization. Therefore,
 the decision is to either bear the loss or leave the systems and 
applications without the patch.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-262">Further, some patches might require the system to 
restart, which may not be possible in a live system. Most administrators
 leave the system and applications without patching. This might leave 
some critical vulnerabilities uncovered, thereby endangering the system.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m21-263"><b><i>Range</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m21-264">The Range is the distance that a signal from the 
wireless network can be effective up to. The range for a wireless 
network depends on the type of wireless network. The range might be 
constrained due to obstacles such as walls. As the signal weakens, it 
may travel a shorter length.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m21-265"><b><i>Implied Trust</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m21-266">When a user requests access to a file or network, the
 implied trust is applied. An implied trust is about trusting a user who
 is the employee of the organization.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-267">Consider an example of implied trust. You hire an 
ethical hacker to test a web application and share key points about the 
application with him. You are enforcing implied trust with the ethical 
hacker. The ethical hacker may simply misuse the information that he 
gains from you and by exploring the application.</p>

<p id="cn-m21-268">In another example, a hacker sends a phishing email 
to a user. The phishing Email is made to come from either the bank or 
some known individual. In this scenario, the implied trust is misused.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-71">Whenever an application is being developed, it is 
essential to follow secure application development practices. Secure 
application development will ensure that the application meets all the 
requirements as defined by the company’s policy.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-72">It is essential to develop the application according 
to these practices to ensure the application will not be vulnerable to 
exploits, leading to potential data loss, or the data could be 
compromised.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-73">After the application is built, a protected process is followed to test and then securely deploy it.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-74">In this exercise, you will learn various concepts related to secure application development, deployment, and automation.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-91"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m19-c-1" src="ApplicationHardeningDeploymentTechniques_files/image-m19-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-92"><b>Software Development Environment</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-93">There are various stages of software development. Each
 stage needs to have a different and independent environment. In each 
stage, either the application is developed or tested using its 
environment.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-94">For example, the development needs to be done in a 
separate environment than testing. The reason is that the developer’s 
system would have a near to perfect environment that will make the 
application run. The tester would not be able to replicate the 
real-world scenarios. Therefore, the testing environment needs to be 
different.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-95">Some of the key environments that are used in software development are:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-96"><b><i>Development</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-97">In the development environment, the developers code 
the application. In this environment, for coding, you will find tools, 
such as Microsoft Visual Studio, Eclipse, Apache NetBeans, and Microsoft
 Code. The choice of coding application depends on the developer’s 
preference and organization’s requirements. Other than the coding 
application, you will also find version control applications, such as 
SVN.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-98"><b><i>Test</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-99">Depending on the type of method, such as Waterfall or 
Agile, being used for developing the application, the testers will 
either test the full or partial application. The testing environment is 
not a full replica of the development environment, but it contains only 
the necessary hardware and software to run the application for testing 
purposes.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-100"><b><i>Staging</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-101">Unlike testing, the staging environment replicates 
the production environment. The idea is to simulate the production 
environment and then test the application before it goes out to the 
production environment. The staging tests are always performed before 
the application is moved to the production stage.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-102"><b><i>Production</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-103">After the application has been through various 
stages, and if it is found working, it is then moved to the production 
environment, which is the live environment. The application is made 
available to the users, who can either be internal or external to the 
organization. Depending on the application architecture, the production 
environment is likely to contain a Web server and database server. 
Several organizations protect Web applications with a Web Application 
Firewall (WAF).</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-104"><b><i>Quality Assurance (QA)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-105">The software may contain different types of errors, 
which are known as defects. Some of the common types of defects that can
 exist within the software are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-106">

<li id="cn-m19-106">Functional</li>

<li id="cn-m19-107">Compilation</li>

<li id="cn-m19-108">Run time</li>

<li id="cn-m19-109">Logical errors</li>

<li id="cn-m19-110">Inappropriate error handling</li>

<li id="cn-m19-111">Calculation</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m19-112">It is important to note that in the software 
development lifecycle, the testing occurs quite late. Therefore, if any 
of the defects are present in the software, they can either be caught 
late in the lifecycle, or there can be a possibility that the defects 
slip through the testing process.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-113">Quality assurance is a method to keep your 
applications defect-free. Some policies and guidelines define the 
policies and procedures that must be followed while developing and 
testing the application.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-114">This broad-level concept can be applied in any type 
of product development across industries. For example, you would often 
buy a product, such as an electronic gadget, and find a small sticker 
mentioning Quality Check OK.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-115">Software assurance is a subset of quality assurance. 
It is a process to ensure that the software functions as it is supposed 
to and is free from defects. Software assurance is more focused on 
developing software free from any kind of vulnerabilities and defects 
that are security-related.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-116">The software assurance process is built into the 
software development lifecycle, which integrates the methods of 
preventing, responding, mitigating, and remediating the defects 
throughout the lifecycle.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-117">The majority of Internet users connect to Web 
applications, which are used for various purposes, such as online 
banking, shopping, car rental, etc.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-118">However, it is important to ponder what happens when 
Web applications are not secure. Web applications can be hacked. Such 
hacking incidents take place because there are bugs or defects within 
the Web applications. The hackers tend to find such errors and exploit 
them for their gains.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-119">When an attack on a Web application takes place, it 
either loses the data or stops functioning. The outcome of the Web 
application depends on the type of hack that has been conducted. For 
example, a hacker may simply walk away with the data without causing any
 functionality issues. On the other hand, a hacker may simply gain 
control of the entire application and its administrative privileges.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-120"><b><i>Software Assurance Risks</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-121">When developing software, different types of risks 
must be thought through. The risks can be categorized into three 
different categories:</p>

<p id="cn-m19-122"><b>Design Errors</b></p>

<p id="cn-m19-123">It is often said that no software can be bug-free, 
and it is true because, intentionally or unintentionally, the software 
developers will leave defects within the software. Malicious entities, 
such as hackers, later then exploit these defects. The attack on the 
software can be in the form of malware, vulnerability exploitation, or 
even through zero-day vulnerability discoveries and exploitation.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-124">One method to prevent design errors is to use the best practices for secure software development and using the tools.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-125"><b>Ever Changing Technological Environment</b></p>

<p id="cn-m19-126">The technological landscape is changing daily. With 
new technology, there is always a risk of introducing new errors because
 the software developers are not skilled enough to handle these errors. 
On the other hand, hackers are one step ahead in their technology 
awareness and develop innovative methods to find bugs and defects with 
the developed software.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-127"><b>Malicious Insiders</b></p>

<p id="cn-m19-128">A malicious insider is an employee of the company. 
This person conducts malicious activity, which may include creating 
vulnerabilities in the software when it is being developed.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-129">More than the security or any other kind of defects, 
finding malicious insiders is a more difficult task. During the 
development process, you need to safeguard the code being developed. It 
must be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is not developed with a 
backdoor or any other security loophole. Best practices should be 
applied when hiring developers. The organization must ensure a thorough 
and strict background check.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-130"><b><i>Software Assurance Tools</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-131">As part of the software assurance process, you would 
need to perform several tests on the software being developed. There are
 several software assurance tools that you can use to ensure a secure 
software product. Some of the key software assurance tools that you can 
use are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-132">

<li id="cn-m19-132"><b>FindBugs</b>: Used for static analysis of Java code</li>

<li id="cn-m19-133"><b>Peach</b>: Is a fuzzing tool that can generate artificial input into a developed software</li>

<li id="cn-m19-134"><b>SonarQube</b>: Is an open-source tool for performing a static code analysis with several pre-defined rules</li>

<li id="cn-m19-135"><b>Yet Another Source Code Analyzer (YASCA</b>): Is 
an open-source tool that can test software for vulnerabilities and code 
quality. It can also be used for performance testing and adherence to 
best practices.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m19-136"><b><i>Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-137">The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an 
open framework that can be tailored by an organization to manage risks 
faced with software development and security. Some of the key components
 of SAMM are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-138">

<li id="cn-m19-138">Evaluate the software security practices within an organization</li>

<li id="cn-m19-139">Build a software security program</li>

<li id="cn-m19-140">Demonstrate improvements to an existing security assurance program</li>

<li id="cn-m19-141">Define and measure security-related activities that exist in an organization</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m19-142">SAMM can be applied and implemented with an 
organization of any size. It can also be applied to the entire 
organization or even a single project.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-143"><b>SAMM Architecture</b></p>

<p id="cn-m19-144"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m19-c-2" src="ApplicationHardeningDeploymentTechniques_files/image-m19-c-2.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1 Screenshot of SAMM Architecture"><figcaption>Figure

 development in the SAMM architecture Governance &gt; Construction &gt; 
Verification &gt; Operations</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m19-145">In the given architecture, SAMM defines four critical
 functions that span throughout the entire software development 
lifecycle. Each function has three security practices that must be 
followed as shown below:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-146">

<li id="cn-m19-146">Governance</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m19-147">- Strategy and Metrics</p>

<p id="cn-m19-148">- Policy and Compliance</p>

<p id="cn-m19-149">- Education and Guidance</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-150">

<li id="cn-m19-150">Construction</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m19-151">- Security Requirements</p>

<p id="cn-m19-152">- Threat Assessment</p>

<p id="cn-m19-153">- Secure Architecture</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-154">

<li id="cn-m19-154">Verification</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m19-155">- Design Review</p>

<p id="cn-m19-156">- Implementation Review</p>

<p id="cn-m19-157">- Security Testing</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-158">

<li id="cn-m19-158">Operations</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m19-159">- Issue Management</p>

<p id="cn-m19-160">- Environment Hardening</p>

<p id="cn-m19-161">- Operational Enablement</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-162"><b>Provisioning and Deprovisioning</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-163">Provisioning and deprovisioning can be used in a 
different context. It can be used in the context of user accounts. When 
you create a user account and assign permissions to access resources on 
the network, you have provisioned a user account. Similarly, when you 
remove access for a user account, you are deprovisioning the user 
account's permissions.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-164">Similar to the user context, provisioning and 
deprovisioning are also used in the application context. You configure 
an application to run on a particular system, which means you are 
provisioning it. When you remove the application from the system, you 
are deprovisioning it.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-165">Another context is the threads, processes, and 
services. Sometimes, you need a process to run with elevated privileges.
 This is, again, provisioning. When the privileges are removed for the 
thread or the processes, it is the deprovisioning process.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-166"><b>Integrity Measurement</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-167">Each software or operating system runs with a certain
 set of executables. When an executable is invoked, its integrity is 
checked and verified to ensure that it is legitimate. There is an 
integrity measurement tool or application that tracks the hash values of
 the executables. As and when required, the tool can produce the list of
 executables along with their hash values. With the list of executables 
and hash values, it is easy to track if there are unknown or 
illegitimate executables running in the system.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-168"><b>Secure Coding Techniques</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-169">Developing a secure application is generally 
considered to be difficult. There is no single practice that makes an 
application secure. You would have to put several methods into practice,
 but you have to remember that you should not make things complicated 
for yourself.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-170">The following is a list of secure coding techniques 
that you can use, but it is important to note that some will only apply 
depending on your requirements and development environment. For example,
 if a database is not used, you need not worry about normalization and 
stored procedures.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-171"><b><i>Normalization</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-172">Data normalization is the process of reorganizing the
 data in the database to ensure that there is no duplicate or redundant 
data and that all the data is stored logically. Grouping of data that 
has dependencies on other data will increase the database performance.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-173">When you use a database for an application, the 
database may contain redundant data, which can eventually impact the 
database performance. A larger table is broken down into smaller tables 
with the normalization process, further connected using relationships.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-174">There are different levels of normalization. They are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-175">

<li id="cn-m19-175">1NF - First Normal Form</li>

<li id="cn-m19-176">2NF - Second Normal Form</li>

<li id="cn-m19-177">3NF - Third Normal Form</li>

<li id="cn-m19-178">BCNF - Boyce-Codd Normal Form</li>

<li id="cn-m19-179">4NF - Fourth Normal Form</li>

<li id="cn-m19-180">5NF - Fifth Normal Form</li>

<li id="cn-m19-181">6NF - Sixth Normal Form</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m19-182"><b><i>Stored procedures</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-183">A stored procedure is a group of SQL statements that 
can be reused as and when required. For example, if you have to run a 
SQL query multiple times, you can save the SQL query in the form of a 
stored procedure and then execute it. This saves you the trouble of 
rewriting the query.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-184">A set of parameters can also be passed to stored 
procedures, which then are acted upon. Stored procedures are primarily 
used to prevent SQL Injection attacks, which allows the attacker to gain
 access to the database, to modify or extract information.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-185"><b><i>Obfuscation/Camouflage</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-186">Obfuscation is a method in which an application is 
written to make it difficult to interpret its inner functionality. This 
is used as a security method to prevent an attacker from understanding 
the application’s code.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-187">By implementing obfuscation for an application will 
harden the application and prevent that an attacker can tamper or 
reverse engineer the application’s code.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-188">A downside to obfuscation is that troubleshooting 
issues will be more difficult especially if the developer is not

<h4 id="cn-m19-189"><b><i>Code Reuse/Dead Code</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-190">Code reuse is a method of utilizing the existing code
 into new software or application being developed. When you have a piece
 of code that is working with an existing application, it is possible 
that the code can be used with another application that you are 
developing.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-191">Let’s take an example. You have a login form in an 
existing application that verifies the users and authenticates them. If 
the user does not exist, it also allows the users to create an account 
for themselves. In the new application that you are developing, you need
 to develop the same features on the login form. Since you already have 
the code, which has passed the testing stage and is live in the 
production environment, you can use the same code.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-192">When you reuse a piece of code, there is a possibility of introducing dead code into the new application.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-193">For example, the new application you are developing 
uses the same login form code, including the CAPTCHA functionality. 
However, the new application login form does not require CAPTCHA 
functionality.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-194">You integrate the complete piece of code without 
removing the CAPTCHA functionality. This means the code relating to 
CAPTCHA is the dead code.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-195">It will exist within the new application's login form but will have no purpose and is never executed.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-196"><b><i>Server-side vs. Client-side Execution and Validation</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-197">Whenever you submit a form in a Web application, 
there is a certain level of input validation that is being performed. 
Validation is required to restrict the user from entering any type of 
malicious input. To perform user validation, two different methods can 
be used.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-198">The first method is the server-side validation 
method. In this method, the input is sent to the server for validation. 
After server validation, the validation response is sent back to the 
user, typically in a new dynamically generated page. In the second 
method, the validation is performed on the client-side. The user input 
is validated in the Web browser before it is submitted to the server.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-199">When you talk about the server-side validation, it 
provides better security against the malicious inputs. This is because 
the server owns the responsibility of performing validation of the user.
 On the other hand, the client-side validation provides a better user 
experience. However, it can be easily bypassed. For example, JavaScript 
is mostly used for client-side validation. If JavaScript is switched off
 in the Web browser, then the user can bypass the client-side 
validation.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-200"><b><i>Memory Management</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-201">When developing an application, the developers must 
use security memory management methods while coding. If memory 
management is not handled properly, it can lead to various 
memory-related vulnerabilities, such as memory leak or buffer overflows,
 which can then be exploited by the attacker.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-202"><b><i>Use of Third-party Libraries and Software Development Kits (SDKs)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-203">When you are developing an application, there are 
several components or features that you can avoid developing by using 
third-party libraries or SDKs. For example, if you need to implement 
encryption within the application, you either write the code yourself or
 use third-party libraries. The better choice would be to use 
third-party libraries, which have been properly tested and used by 
several other developers.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-204">SDKs are also third-party libraries, but a specific 
vendor provides them.  For example, Google or Microsoft may provide SDKs
 with their products or use the SDKs to integrate with other products.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-205">Using third-party libraries and SDKs help you avoid 
several software development errors. You can simply plug-in the 
third-party libraries or use SDKs that will provide several features.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-206"><b><i>Data Exposure</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-207">At any given time, data can be in one of the three stages:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-208">

<li id="cn-m19-208">Data at rest</li>

<li id="cn-m19-209">Data in transit</li>

<li id="cn-m19-210">Data in use</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m19-211">When developing an application, the developers need 
to ensure that data, at whichever stage, must be handled correctly. For 
example, if a user uses the application and submitting or downloading 
the data, then the transit data should be protected by encryption. In 
similar cases with the other two stages, the data must never be exposed 
to any individual who is not entitled to see or access the data.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-212">If the data is exposed to an individual, who may be 
malicious, the data can not only lose its confidentiality, but its 
availability and integrity can also be at stake. Proper coding 
techniques should be used by implementing security controls to protect 
the data at any given stage.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-213"><b>Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-214">The Open Web Application Security Project is a 
non-profit worldwide community dedicated in assisting organizations and 
developers to improve the security of the development of software web 
applications.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-215">Open Web Application Security Project releases the 
top 10 Web application vulnerabilities every three to four years. This 
data is collected from various partners and organizations through 
extensive research, after which the top 10 Web applications are 
selected. There are hundreds of Web application vulnerabilities but the 
most used attacks are listed in the top ten of OWASP.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-216">When conducting a penetration test the top ten vulnerabilities can be used as listed by OWASP.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-217">The top 10 Web application vulnerabilities of 2017 released by OWASP are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-218">

<li id="cn-m19-218">A1:2017-Injection</li>

<h3 id="cn-m19-228"><b>Software Diversity</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-229">With the technology pacing at a great speed, 
customers have formed different expectations and layout different 
requirements. You may have to bring out different variants of an 
application to run on different architectures. The variations that are 
used in the applications are known as software diversity.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-230">Let’s first understand the meaning of diversity. In a
 society, there are people from different cultures. They live and work 
together. This is the diversity of the society that incorporates 
different cultures. Similarly, you may have to develop different 
variants of an application to meet the customer requirements, which is 
defined as software diversity.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-231">Software diversity impacts software development 
phases. In the early phases of software development, you need to 
understand the various requirements of the customer. The requirements 
are then developed in the form of an application using different 
architectures. Software diversity, however, does add complexity to the 
application as it needs to be designed to run on different hardware 
architectures.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-232">One method through which the software diversity can 
be achieved is by using a multi-compiler, which embeds a diversification
 engine into the code. When the code is compiled, the multi-variant 
execution environment (MVEE) uses the correct binary to execute. The 
multi-compiler can generate different builds of a software depending on 
the environment. Each build, even in different environments, behaves in 
the same manner. However, the security risks may differ in each build in
 their own respective environments.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-233"><b>Automation/Scripting</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-234">An administrator or a security professional has to 
perform several tasks that require manual intervention. Let’s consider 
an example of an administrator who performs system administration tasks 
on various servers daily. Each server takes nearly 30 minutes of the 
administrator’s time. Depending on the number of servers, you can use 
multiple the number with 30 to get the total number of minutes that the 
administrator spends on a manual activity. To solve this problem, it is 
best to automate these tasks. One of the best methods is to use 
scripting, which can reduce the administrator’s manual intervention.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-235">Most of the operating systems, such as Windows and Linux, provide the scripting environment.</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-236">

<li id="cn-m19-236"><b>Windows</b>: PowerShell, batch files</li>

<li id="cn-m19-237"><b>Linux</b>: Bash and other variants</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m19-238">A few things, whether you use Linux or Windows 
environment, remain constant. Scripts use variables and various 
statements, such as if…else.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-239">A variable in a script is mainly used for storing 
data temporarily in memory. A variable can hold different types of data,
 such as characters, white spaces, alphanumeric characters, special 
characters, and numerous others.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-240">There are two types of variables:</p>

<p id="cn-m19-241">Environmental variables&nbsp;are defined for the 
current shell. These variables are then inherited and used by the child 
shells and the processes. On the other hand, shell variables&nbsp;work 
within the shell in which they are defined.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-242">Example:</p>

<p id="cn-m19-243">In a script, you can declare a variable and assign a value to it.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-244">x=10</p>

<p id="cn-m19-245">Rather than using the value directly, which can be 
changed, you can simply use the variable. Even if you change the 
variable's value, you don’t have to change it in the code because only 
the variable is being used.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-246">Let’s now look at different types of loop statements.</p>

<span class="cn-quote" id="cn-m19-247"><b><i>Note: </i></b><i>This module only provides a brief overview of scripting and loop statements. </i></span>

<h3 id="cn-m19-248"><b>Task 1 -  If…else Statements</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-249">The if…else statements are mainly used for making a decision and, therefore, are known as decision-making statements.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-250">When you have to choose from two given choices, the 
if…else statements work well.  However, there may be a scenario in which
 you will have to work with multiple conditions to choose from, then in 
that scenario, esac… statements need to be used.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-251">In shell scripting, you can use three different types of if…else statements. They are the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-252">

<li id="cn-m19-252">if...fi statement</li>

<li id="cn-m19-253">if...else...fi statement</li>

<li id="cn-m19-254">if...elif...else...fi statement</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m19-307"><b><i>Automated Courses of Action</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-308">As described earlier, scripting helps an 
administrator automate certain actions that they would perform manually.
 Scripting requires programming knowledge, but it serves various 
benefits. Some of the key benefits are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m19-309">

<li id="cn-m19-309"><b>Output</b>: No matter how many times you run the script, you will get the same output because the code remains static.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-310"><b>Speed</b>: The task that you can manually accomplish in one hour, the script will cut it down to a few minutes.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-311"><b>Productivity</b>: When you save time in 
performing a task, you increase your productivity. The time that you 
were spending on manual tasks can be utilized in other tasks.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-312"><b>Cost</b>: When you save time, you save money. Scripts provide the same result every time in lesser time.</li>

<li id="cn-m19-313"><b>Errors</b>: Manually doing a task can lead to errors. Different individuals also have different results. Scripts reduce the errors.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m19-314"><b><i>Continuous Monitoring</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-315">Whenever you deploy one or more systems, you have to 
continuously monitor them, which means that you should have an 
around-the-clock monitoring system. You need to continuously monitor the
 systems for performance and security, which are related to 
vulnerabilities and threats.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-316"><b><i>Continuous Validation</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-317">Continuous validation is the process of performing 
black box and white box testing on the software builds. The idea is to 
perform effective testing and ensure that all bugs are located and 
reported correctly to the development team. Several organizations use 
various automated tools to generate a stable build, which is virtually 
free from errors. However, the testing team must ensure that the stable 
build is also tested and put through continuous validation.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-318"><b><i>Continuous Integration</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-319">Continuous integration is a type of development 
process in which, rather than committing the code once, the developers 
continue to commit the code regularly. The frequency of the code commit 
is several times a day. As the developers finish a piece of code, they 
commit the code, followed by automated builds and automated tests. 
Continuous integration requires the developers to work together and 
integrate code for building a complete product.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-320"><b><i>Continuous Delivery</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-321">Continuous delivery extends the continuous 
integration by incorporating the new changes into the application 
builds. In continuous delivery, the release process is also automated. 
When you integrate your code into an existing code base, the application
 can be deployed with a click of a button.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-322">Continuous delivery frequency can vary from 
organization to organization. Some may decide the frequency to be daily,
 while others may decide the frequency to be weekly or fortnightly. 
However, it is recommended that the code commit frequency should be as 
short as possible. The key intent is to catch the defects if there are 
any in each build.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m19-323"><b><i>Continuous Deployment</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m19-324">In the continuous deployment, all the code that has 
passed through all stages of software development is released into 
production. The continuous deployment process is automated and does not 
require any human intervention. With automation, you can perform quick 
deployments into different environments if required.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-325">The fundamental difference between continuous 
delivery and continuous deployment is that continuous delivery builds, 
tests, and performs a manual deployment to production. On the other 
hand, continuous deployment follows the same process, but there is an 
automated deployment instead of manual deployment. As soon as the build 
is ready, tested, it is deployed to the production environment 
automatically.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-326"><b>Scalability</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-327">Each system you use has a certain level of resources,
 which are consumed by the operating system and applications. There are 
times when the applications require more resources to provide optimal 
performance. However, if the system has run out of resources, then you 
have to look at scalability. You can either add more resources to the 
system and gain optimal application performance. This method is known as
 scaling up.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-328">On the other hand, if there is no possibility of 
adding more resources to the system, you can add another system to 
handle the load of the application. When you add another load, the 
application load can be split between both the systems. This method is 
called scaling out.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-329">In the simplest term, scalability means increasing 
the resources to meet the demands of the resources generated by the 
application(s).</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-330"><b>Elasticity</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-331">Even though elasticity is similar to scalability, but
 it works differently. When there are workloads that increase, the 
resources are provided to the application in an automated fashion. When 
the workload decrease, the resources are removed. In elasticity, you 
mostly work with the scale-out method where more systems are added to 
handle the workload. Elasticity is a popular phenomenon in the cloud 
environment.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m19-332"><b>Version Control</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m19-333">In the software development world, a developer writes
 the code. Then, the code is reviewed and updated from time to time, not
 only to remove bugs but also to improve.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-334">For example, a slight change in the code might add to
 application performance. Every time the code is reviewed and updated, 
its version changes. Tracking every change in the code is called version
 control and can also apply to the documents you create.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-335">When you make a change to the code, it needs to be 
tracked for version. Let’s consider an example. You write the code, and 
your peer makes a change to the code. If there is no version control 
system in place, it will not be possible to determine who made the 
change, what the changes were, and when the changes were made. Every 
time a change is made to the code, its version is automatically saved. 
Any time you need to revert to the previous version, you can do it 
without any hassle.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-336">When a version control system is in place, the 
developers need to work on the code and check it. After the developers 
make the code changes on their local systems, the code is then checked 
back into the version control system.</p>

<p id="cn-m19-337">Typically, when the developer is checking in the 
code, there is a need to add a description of the changes. In this 
process, all changes are tracked in the version control system. When 
there is a need to check out, for example, the first version, it can be 
done by checking out the code.</p>

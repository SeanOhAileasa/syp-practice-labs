<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m11-79"><b>Exercise 1 - Using Directory Services to Administer User and Group Accounts</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m11-80">Active Directory is a central repository that contains
 various objects, such as users, groups, and computers. Active Directory
 maintains the central control of the users, groups, computers, and 
services running within a domain. You can configure sites, domains, 
forests, and organizational units (OU) to manage the Active Directory. 
For example, the root is always the forest, which can have one or more 
domains. A domain has distinct security boundaries. You can have sites, 
which can contain one or more domains, or a domain can contain multiple 
sites. If your organization has multiple departments, then you can 
create separate OUs for each department.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-81">In Active Directory, one of the key tasks is managing 
users and groups. There are two types of users in Windows. The first 
type is the domain user, who can log on to any domain system in the 
domain with restrictive permissions. The domain users are centrally 
managed in a system known as the domain controller. The domain users can
 be managed using a graphical interface known as Active Directory Users 
and Computers. You can also manage the domain users using Windows 
PowerShell.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-82">The other type of user is a local user, who is 
restricted to the system in which it was created. The local user cannot 
perform a task outside the system in which it was created. It is also 
important to note that a local user cannot be part of any domain group, 
such as Domain Users. Its scope is strictly limited to the local 
computer on which it is created.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-83">In this exercise, you will learn to create local and domain users.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m11-85">After completing this exercise, you should be able to:</p>

<ul id="cn-m11-86">

<li id="cn-m11-86">Create a Local User</li>

<li id="cn-m11-87">Manage the User Account Permissions</li>

<li id="cn-m11-88">Create a Domain User</li>

<li id="cn-m11-89">Add User to a Group</li>

<h3 id="cn-m11-95"><b>Task 1 - Create a Local User</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-96">You can create a local user in any Windows system, 
whether it is part of a domain or not. Assume that you are running a 
system at home with Windows 10. During the installation, you create a 
user, which is local to the system. You can also create several local 
user accounts and use them for various purposes, such as running 
services or allowing other users to log on to the same system.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-97">In this task, you will learn to create a local user. To do this, perform the following steps:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m11-98"><b><i>Step 1</i></b></h4>

<h3 id="cn-m11-134"><b>Task 2 - Manage the User Account Permissions</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-135">The permissions of a user account, whether local or 
domain user, depends on the groups it is part of. Both on the local 
system and in a domain, various groups are created by default. If you 
add a user to a specific group on a local system, the user account 
inherits the default permissions of the group.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-136">To manage the user account permissions, perform the following steps:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m11-137"><b><i>Step 1</i></b></h4>

on to this system with JaneM user, you will be able to. However, if you 
attempt to log on to any other system with the same username, you will 
not be able to. To be able to log on to the domain systems, you need to 
create a domain account. Using a local user account, you can log on to a
 system, you can perform all tasks like a normal user but within the 
same system on which the user account is created.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m11-172"><b>Task 3 - Create a Domain User</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-173">Active Directory serves as a single repository of 
objects, such as user and computer accounts. You can create a user 
account with different levels of permissions. For example, you can 
create a normal user account that has a basic level of permissions, or 
you can create a user account with administrative permissions. There are
 more permissions with which a user account can be created.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-174">A domain user with basic permissions can only perform
 normal functions, like logging on to a domain system and performing 
routine tasks. However, the user cannot perform administrative tasks, 
such as installing an application. To be able to have administrative 
privileges on a domain system, the user must be added to the local 
administrators group. The domain user can also be added to the domain 
groups, which give domain-wide permissions to the user.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-175">In this task, you will create a user domain user account. To do this, perform the following steps:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m11-176"><b><i>Step 1</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m11-177">Ensure that you have powered on the required devices. Connect to <b>PLABDC01</b>. The <b>Server Manager </b>window is displayed.</p>

<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m11-266"><b>Exercise 2 - Authentication Methods </b></h2>

<p id="cn-m11-267">Authentication is the process of validating a user’s 
identity. When a user attempts to log on to a system, user credentials 
are validated to verify the user’s identity. Before the user is granted 
access to any object on the network or even on the system, the user’s 
identity must be validated using the authentication process. For 
example, a user must know not only the username but also the password. 
The combination of both are validated in the authentication process. 
However, the authentication process can also include other factors, such
 as a second factor on which the user is authenticated. The user must 
also provide a one-time password (OTP) that is sent to the user. Once 
the user enters the username, password, and OTP, the user is 
authenticated.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-268">There are different types of authentication methods. Some of the key methods are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m11-269">

<li id="cn-m11-269">Password-based</li>

<li id="cn-m11-270">Multi-factor</li>

<li id="cn-m11-271">Certificate-based</li>

<li id="cn-m11-272">Biometric</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m11-273">The password-based method is the most widely used method. In this exercise, you will learn about various authentication methods.</p>

<h2 class="cn-learningobjectives"><b>Learning Outcomes</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m11-275">After completing this exercise, you will have further knowledge of:</p>

<p id="cn-m11-283"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m11-c-29" src="AuthenticationandAuthorizationImplementationTechniques_files/image-m11-c-29.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m11-284"><b>Federation</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-285">Often there is a need for an organization to conduct 
business with another organization or even a vendor. The organization 
may need to establish network connectivity with another organization and
 share resources on the network. To be able to do this, you need to 
establish a relationship with the other organization’s network and 
create security domains to be able to share network resources. The 
security domains that help you share resources with another organization
 is called the federation process.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-286">In federation, two domains are required. The first 
domain is the Resource Partner, and the second domain is the Accounts 
Partner. When an organization is sharing network resources with the 
other organization, it is called the Resource Partner. For example, a 
Web application or certain network shared folders may be granted access 
to the other organization, which is the Account Partner. The users who 
will be accessing the resources are located in the Account Partner 
domain.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m11-287"><b>Attestation</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-288">A hardware root of trust serves as the foundation to secure operations of a system. It serves two key functions:</p>

<ul id="cn-m11-289">

<li id="cn-m11-289">store encryption keys that are used in the cryptographic functions</li>

<li id="cn-m11-290">enable a secure boot process</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m11-291">Root of trust is implemented in the hardware and, 
therefore, cannot be tampered with. In a normal scenario, a system is 
prone to malware and other types of attacks, and if the encryption keys 
are stored in the system, they can be easily stolen. However, the root 
of trust is immune to a malware attack.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-292">Root of trust can be implemented in two different ways. It can be either:</p>

<ul id="cn-m11-293">

<li id="cn-m11-293">a stand-alone security module</li>

<li id="cn-m11-294">security module that can be embedded within a processor or system on chip (SoC)</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m11-295">There are two types of hardware root of trust:</p>

<ul id="cn-m11-296">

<li id="cn-m11-296"><b>Fixed function</b>: designed to perform a 
specific function, such as data encryption. Other functions it can 
perform is key management and certificate validation. However, other 
than the defined functions, it cannot perform any other functions.</li>

<li id="cn-m11-297"><b>Programmable</b>: is designed to perform complex tasks and functions. It is possible to upgrade a programmable root of trust.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m11-298">A root of trust can be applied using:</p>

<ul id="cn-m11-299">

<li id="cn-m11-299">A private cryptographic key</li>

<li id="cn-m11-300">Physically Unclonable Function (PUF)</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m11-301">With the root of trust enforced, the booting process 
of a system is considered to be genuine, with any applications running 
on it.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-302">Motherboards of the modern systems include a chip 
that is known as a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which provides a 
hardware root of trust for secure computing. When a system has TPM, you 
can configure it by accessing BIOS within the system. A TPM can perform 
various functions, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m11-303">

<li id="cn-m11-303">Storage of encryption keys</li>

<li id="cn-m11-304">Management of encryption keys</li>

<li id="cn-m11-305">Perform encryption and decryption process</li>

<li id="cn-m11-306">Storage of certificates</li>

<li id="cn-m11-307">Storage of passwords</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m11-308">Using the TPM, SecureBoot ensures only the trusted 
operating system bootloaders can load in the system. For the Secureboot 
to work, you need to have two components in the system:</p>

<ul id="cn-m11-309">

<li id="cn-m11-309">UEFI firmware</li>

<li id="cn-m11-310">TPM</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m11-311">Just like the secure boot, Measured Boot Chain also 
works with the Root of Trust. In the Measured Boot process, each object 
in the hierarchy is validated. It starts with the Root of Trust, and 
then the next object in the chain is computing its hash. In this 
process, the current object calculates the hash of the next object and 
stores safely. Using this method, a chain of objects is calculated, and 
their hashes are computed. The hashes can be reported to a management 
station, known as Attestation. When referring to the Measured Boot, the 
hashes are stored in the TPM, the Trusted Platform Module.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-312">When a system boots, each object’s hash is compared with the hashes stored in TPM. If every hash meets, the system boots up.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m11-313"><b>Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-314">When a user needs to access certain resources on a 
network, the user needs to be authenticated and then authorized. After 
the authorization, the user’s activities are logged and tracked using 
the accounting method.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-315">When a user attempts to connect to a network, the 
user needs to be identified, which is the identification process. The 
user is identified with a username. Once the identification is complete,
 the user needs to be authenticated, which is done with the password. 
The user’s identity is proven after the user provides the correct 
password.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-316">After the user is authenticated, the user can access 
resources on the network on which they are authorized. If the user is 
not permitted on certain resources, such as files and folders, the user 
is considered to be unauthorized when he or she attempts to access them.
 For example, let’s consider an example of two folders, Projects, and 
Finance, that are shared on the network. The user is part of the 
Operations team and has access to the Projects folder. After the user 
logs on to the network, after authorization, the user can access the 
Projects folder. On the other hand, the user does not have permissions 
to the Finance folder. When the user attempts to access the Finance 
folder, the user gets the access denied message.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-317">After the authorization is completed, the user 
performs certain access on the network resources. If appropriate logging
 is enabled, the user’s actions are tracked and logged into the logs on 
the server where the user is connected or performing actions. 
Alternatively, the logs may be collated in a central environment. The 
logs are used for auditing purposes.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m11-319"><b>Cloud vs. On-premises Authentication Requirements</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-320">Fundamentally, the process of AAA remains the same in
 the cloud or on-premise environment. As stated earlier, the user must 
be identified and authenticated before being authorized to access 
network resources. Similarly, the cloud also requires user 
identification and authentication.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-321">In the local environment, you have directory 
services, such as Active Directory, that handle the identification and 
authentication part. In the cloud environment, you have 
Directory-As-A-Service (DaaS) that handles user identification and 
authentication. However, in most of the cloud environment, you also have
 Identity and Access Management (IAM) that can handle not only the user 
and group creation but also the access management for them. For example,
 Amazon AWS offers AWS IAM, which allows you to create and manage users 
and groups. Using AWS IAM, you can also enable multi-factor 
authentication and integrate it with your organization’s directory 
services.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-322">Similarly, IAM can also be installed and configured 
in an on-premise environment. However, one has to remember that there 
are additional overheads when dealing with on-premise infrastructure. 
You would need to procure servers as well as a license for IAM.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m11-323"><b>Technologies</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-324">In most cases, users are forced to provide a password
 to authenticate themselves. However, various other methods can be used 
to add another authentication method along with the password. Let’s look
 at some of these methods that can be used for authentication.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m11-325"><b><i>Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m11-326">TOTP is a password that has a timestamp and is valid 
only for a specific duration. For example, a TOTP is valid only for 30 
seconds, and after 30 seconds are over, the TOTP expires and cannot be 
used anymore.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m11-327"><b><i>HMAC-based one-time password (HOTP)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m11-328">HOTP uses hash-based message authentication codes 
(HMAC) functions to create a one-time password. HOTP uses a secret key 
and also an incrementing counter. Then, the HMAC creates the hash value,
 which is then converted into a 6-digit or sometimes 8-digit HOTP value.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m11-329"><b><i>Short Message Service (SMS)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m11-330">SMS is used for sending short messages up to 160 
characters. A mobile device can send and receive messages. SMS is the 
key delivery methods for OTPs or TOTP’s. OTPs and TOTPs are time-bound 
messages that are delivered via SMS and expire after a certain time 
period. For example, assume that you are attempting to log on to your 
bank’s website. You need to authenticate yourself with your username and
 password. The website will then send an SMS with an OTP to your 
registered mobile device’s number which provides a second level of 
authentication which is also referred to as Multi-factor authentication 
(MFA). The OTP needs to be entered to complete the authentication 
process. A time limit is associated to the OTP and can vary depending on
 the application being accessed.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m11-331"><b><i>Token key</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m11-332">A token key is also known as a key fob, which is the 
size of a USB drive. It contains a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) that 
displays a number, which is generated by a server. The token key is 
synchronized with the server, which updates the number every 60-seconds.
 When you need to authenticate using a token key, you need to provide 
the user credentials and the number generated. This combination of 
username, password, and the number is then used to authenticate the 
user. However, if the number changes while you are entering it for 
authentication, the authentication will fail. There is no sequence to 
these numbers that are displayed on the token key. These numbers are 
dynamically generated by the server and synchronized with the token 
keys.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m11-333"><b><i>Static Codes</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m11-334">An authenticator app generally generates static 
codes. When you configure an authenticator app, it generates static 
codes that you have to store somewhere safe. Static codes are required 
when you lose access to the app, such as a messaging service, you can 
use the static code to recover your access.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m11-335"><b><i>Authentication Applications</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m11-336">Authentication applications are designed to provide 
application-level authentication. Authentication applications also 
support digital signatures. Kerberos is one such example. It is the 
authentication protocol used by Windows servers running Active Directory
 Domain Services. Kerberos uses a centralized server that authenticates 
users to servers and vice versa. It uses an Authentication Server (AS) 
and a Ticket Granting Server (TGS).</p>

<h4 id="cn-m11-337"><b><i>Push Notifications</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m11-338">A push notification is an alert sent to an app 
installed on a mobile device, which can either be a mobile phone or a 
tab. Notifications were initially used for alerting the user about an 
Email that has been received on the mobile phone. However, later, push 
notifications were adopted as a marketing strategy and are now used with
 almost all apps installed on a mobile device.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-339">For example, let’s consider that you have WhatsApp 
installed on your mobile. When a message is received, a notification is 
generated by default. When you install an app on a mobile device, the 
notifications are automatically enabled for the app. However, in the 
Settings section, you can navigate to the notifications section and 
disable notifications for a particular app.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-340">It is important to note that push notifications are 
app-driven, not the mobile make or the mobile platform. For example, 
push notifications will work on an app, whether it is installed on an 
Android phone or an iPhone.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m11-341"><b><i>Phone Call</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m11-342">A phone call can also be used for authentication. 
Some mobile apps, when you are setting them up on the mobile device, may
 trigger a call on your registered mobile number. After you verify 
yourself, the app will then start working.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-343">An example can be an app that uses a phone call as an
 authentication method. For example, let’s consider that you stay in an 
apartment building. When a visitor comes, the security guard feeds the 
information in an app, which triggers an automated call to your 
registered mobile number. You have to press a key to either authorize 
the visitor to enter or press another key to reject the incoming visitor
 request.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-346">Biometric authentication utilizes a physical 
characteristic of an individual to authenticate him or her. For example,
 authentication of an individual can be done using a fingerprint or a 
retina scan. Once the user is authenticated, the user is authorized to 
access the system or the data within a system. Biometric authentication 
is widely used at the entry point of a room or even with laptops. 
Several latest laptop models are equipped with fingerprint 
authentication. Many mobile manufacturers have integrated the 
fingerprint and face scanning methods to authenticate a user.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-347">The biometric process has two parts to it. The first 
part is the enrolment in which a physical characteristic of an 
individual is registered. The system does not store the physical 
characteristics but converts it to a numerical value and stores it in 
the database. The second part is the authentication. When a user uses 
the physical characteristic for the authentication purpose, it is again 
converted to the numeric value and compared with the stored value in the
 database. If both the values match, then the user is authenticated.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m11-364"><b>Fingerprint</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-365">Fingerprints can be used for identification or even 
authentication. When you are entering a data center, you would typically
 see a biometric system installed. In most cases, it is the fingerprint 
scanner that authenticates a user, and once the user is authenticated, 
the door to the data center opens. Mobile devices are also equipped with
 fingerprint scanners. Some mobile devices have a fingerprint scanner on
 the back, but several new models have a place for the fingerprint 
scanning on the screen itself. The sensor inside the screen scans the 
fingerprint and authenticates the user.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m11-366"><b>Retina</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-367">The retina scanner scans the pattern of the blood 
vessels of the retina. Each individual has a unique blood vessel 
pattern. After a user’s retina is registered with the retina scanner, 
the same pattern is detected during the authentication. If there is a 
variation in the pattern, the user is not authenticated.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m11-368"><b>Iris</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-369">The iris scanner scans the iris pattern of an individual. If the pattern is matched, then the user is granted access.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m11-370"><b>Facial</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-371">A human face has certain features, such as the shape,
 size, and position of the ear, nose, and eyes. In the facial 
recognition process, the face is scanned for the facial features and 
their size and positioning. Most of the recent mobile models (mid-range 
and high-end) have facial recognition features.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m11-372"><b>Voice</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-373">Each human voice has a certain pattern, pitch, and 
modulation. In the voice recognition feature, these are compared against
 the values stored for that individual.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m11-374"><b>Vein</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-375">Vein recognition is also known as vascular 
biometrics, which is used to scan the veins in fingers, hand, or even in
 the eyeball. The layout of the vein is stored and then later compared 
when the user attempts to authenticate himself or herself.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m11-376"><b>Gait Analysis</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-377">Gait analysis is a method of discovering who you are.
 Each individual has specific body measurement and anatomical factors. 
Gait Analysis is largely used as a method to detect a specific 
individual. When an individual walks, there is a specific style each 
individual has. Using the Gait analysis, a person can be recognized and 
detected.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m11-378"><b>False Acceptance and False Rejection Rates</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-379">False Acceptance Rate (FAR) is a method that 
determines the probability of the number of incorrect requests that will
 be accepted by a biometric system. The formula for calculating FAR is:</p>

<pre id="cn-m11-380"><code>FAR = number of incorrect accepted requests/number of authentication attempts

</code></pre>

<p id="cn-m11-381">The False Rejection Rate (FRR) is a method that 
determines the probability of the number of incorrectly rejected 
authentication attempts by a biometric system. The formula for 
calculating FRR is:</p>

<pre id="cn-m11-382"><code>FRR = number of false rejections / numbers of authentication attempts

</code></pre>

<h3 id="cn-m11-384"><b>Crossover Error Rate(CER)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-385">The CER or Crossover Error Rate occurs when the 
accept (FAR) and reject rates (FRR) are equal or close to each other. In
 this scenario, the biometric system is performing optimally. It is 
always good to have both FRR and FAR close to each other. If they are 
close to each other, this means that the biometric system is working as 
it should be.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-389">When a user attempts to log on to a local system or a
 networked system, the user needs to be first identified and then 
authenticated. In the authentication process, the user has to provide a 
password along with the username, which is part of the identification 
process. Once the user is authenticated, the user can access the system 
or the resources on which the user has been assigned permissions. With 
the username and password combination, single-factor authentication 
occurs.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-390">When a user is asked to enter the user credentials 
and also use another method to complete the authentication process, then
 it is called multifactor authentication. For example, on a system, a 
user provides a username and password and is then prompted to use the 
smart card. This is an example of multifactor authentication.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-391">In multifactor authentication, you can use different 
factors, such as something you have or something you know. You can also 
use attributes, for example, something you exhibit.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-392">To learn more about how to configure multifactor 
authentication in Windows, please refer to your course material or use 
your preferred search engine to research this topic in more detail.</p>

<h2 class="cn-devices"><b>Your Devices</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m11-401">You will be using the following devices in this lab. Please power these on now.</p>

<ul id="cn-m11-402">

<li id="cn-m11-402"><b>PLABDC01 </b>- (Windows Server 2019 - Domain Controller)</li>

<li id="cn-m11-403"><b>PLABWIN10 </b>- (Windows 10 - Domain Member Workstation)</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m11-404"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m11-c-31" src="AuthenticationandAuthorizationImplementationTechniques_files/image-m11-c-31.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m11-405"><b>Factors</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-406">Multifactor authentication mechanism comprises multiple authentication factors, which can include two or more of the following:</p>

<ul id="cn-m11-407">

<li id="cn-m11-407"><b>Something you know (the knowledge factor</b>): 
This includes the password and also the answers to the secret questions.
 A user must provide this to be able to authenticate himself or herself.</li>

<li id="cn-m11-408"><b>Something you have (the possession factor</b>): This includes something that you have. It could be a one-time password (OTP), a security token, or even an identity card.</li>

<li id="cn-m11-409"><b>Something you are (the inherence factor</b>): 
This includes the biological traits, which are used for authentication. 
It could include a retina scan, fingerprint scan, iris scan, voice 
recognition, and face recognition.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m11-410">You can use a combination of something you know and 
something you are. This makes authentication stronger than simply using 
something you know, which is a password typically.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-411">In recent times, location factors are also being used
 for multifactor authentication. Most smartphones have a GPS feature, 
which makes this authentication possible. It relates to somewhere you 
are - your location is used as authentication. For example, a user is 
allowed to work from home, and his or her home location is considered 
the authentication factor.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-412">It is also possible to use the time factor as another
 authentication factor. For example, a user cannot access his or her 
account outside office hours. This prevents any misuse of the user’s 
account outside the office hours.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m11-413"><b><i>Multifactor Authentication Technologies</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m11-414">Some of the key multifactor authentication technologies are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m11-415">

<li id="cn-m11-415">Security tokens</li>

<li id="cn-m11-416">Soft tokens</li>

<li id="cn-m11-417">Mobile authentication</li>

<li id="cn-m11-418">Biometric authentication methods - retina scans, 
iris scans, fingerprint scans, finger vein scans, facial recognition, 
voice recognition, and so on.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m11-419"><b>Attributes</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-420">Other than the factors, certain attributes can be validated. These attributes are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m11-421">

<li id="cn-m11-421"><b>Somewhere you are - </b>It is an address where you can be located. It uses Geolocation technology to identify your location.</li>

<li id="cn-m11-422"><b>Something you can do - </b>Something you do is 
based on your habits, such as your signature that can be validated. It 
could also be how you type on the keyboard. Windows 10 supports 
picture-based passwords. You have to add gestures to the picture and 
identify them when you want to unlock the system.</li>

<li id="cn-m11-423"><b>Something you exhibit - </b>It could be a trait that can be scanned and validated, such as a neurological trait, which can be scanned using the MRI methods.</li>

<li id="cn-m11-424"><b>Someone you know - </b>It could be someone who can be validated by a chain of trust.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m11-425"><b>Task 1 - Enable Smart Card Logon </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m11-426">Logging in to a system using a smart card typically 
calls for third-party software installed on the client and servers. 
Also, management tools are required to administer the creation and 
revocation of the smart card to corporate users.</p>

<p id="cn-m11-427">In this task, you will select a domain user account to use a smart card for signing-in to the domain network.</p>

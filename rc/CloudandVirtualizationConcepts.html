<p id="cn-m22-73">From the traditional computing model, where you needed
 several servers to host applications and data, organizations have 
started to scale down their datacenters. Organizations have been able to
 considerably reduce the number of physical servers by implementing 
virtualization and cloud computing. Virtualization is a concept that 
uses the physical resources of a system to run several virtual machines 
on the system. Each of these machines is a virtual representation of a 
physical system. Depending on the resources available, a physical system
 can host several virtual machines.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-74">Cloud computing runs on virtualization. The concept of
 cloud computing is to make the infrastructure, operating systems, and 
applications available to the users in a remote environment. The user 
needs to have only a system and an Internet connection to access these 
resources. The concept of cloud computing runs on on-demand allocation 
of resources.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-75">In this exercise, you will learn about the concepts of cloud and virtualization.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-97"><b>Cloud Computing Models</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-98">There are different types of Cloud Computing models 
available. When a user is accessing something in a cloud environment, 
they are accessing a cloud computing model, which defines the services 
that are delivered to the users. For example, if you access gmail.com 
using a Web browser, you are accessing the Software as a Service (SaaS) 
model.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-99">The business requirements of the organization govern which cloud computing model is implemented.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-100">The types of cloud computing model are:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m22-101"><b><i>Software as a Service (SaaS)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m22-102">In Software as a Service (SaaS), an application is 
licensed to users after they purchase a subscription. The license holder
 must then renew their subscription to continue using the service. 
Without the subscription, only a limited features may be available for 
users. Typically, users access the application through a Web browser.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-103">Examples of SaaS include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-104">

<li id="cn-m22-104">Dropbox</li>

<li id="cn-m22-105">Microsoft OneDrive</li>

<li id="cn-m22-106">Microsoft Office 365</li>

<li id="cn-m22-107">Cisco WebEx</li>

<li id="cn-m22-108">Citrix GoToMeeting</li>

<li id="cn-m22-109">Google Apps</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m22-110"><b><i>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) </i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m22-111">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is an online 
service that involves the virtualization of underlying network 
infrastructures, such as physical computing resources, location, data 
partitioning, scaling, security, and backups. Virtual machines, virtual 
network devices, and software-defined networking are also parts of the 
IaaS model.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-112">IaaS provides flexibility to upscale and downscale the infrastructure as required. This is mainly because it allows the team to:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-113">

<li id="cn-m22-113">Create virtual machines (VMs)</li>

<li id="cn-m22-114">Install operating systems on each VM</li>

<li id="cn-m22-115">Deploy middleware</li>

<li id="cn-m22-116">Create storage buckets</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m22-117">Examples of IaaS are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-118">

<li id="cn-m22-118">Amazon EC2</li>

<li id="cn-m22-119">Cisco Metapod</li>

<li id="cn-m22-120">Microsoft Azure</li>

<li id="cn-m22-121">Google Compute Engine (GCE)</li>

</ul>

<ol id="cn-m22-122">

</ol>

<h4 id="cn-m22-123"><b><i>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m22-124">Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud platform that
 provides an infrastructure to develop web applications, without the 
need for a complex infrastructure to be managed in the backend. PaaS 
reduces the cost of purchasing and maintaining hardware to run these 
specific applications. The Cloud Service Providers maintain the hardware
 in the backend, then this Cloud Service can be purchased on a 
subscription based on usage required.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-125">Examples of PaaS are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-126">

<li id="cn-m22-126">AWS Databases</li>

<li id="cn-m22-127">Microsoft Azure Databases</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m22-128"><b><i>Anything as a Service (XaaS)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m22-129">Anything as a Service (XaaS) refers to any IT functions that can be delivered over the Internet as a service.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-130">XaaS can also be defined as anything that a Cloud 
Service Provider can offer, and it includes the above mentioned services
 SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS. As cloud computing evolves, the amount and type 
of services increase.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-131"><b>Types of Clouds</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-132">There are different types of clouds, which are known as cloud deployment models. These types are as follows:</p>

<h4 id="cn-m22-133"><b><i>Private Cloud</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m22-134">A private cloud can be set up either by the 
organization itself or by a third-party service provider. A single 
organization owns the private cloud, and the applications and data are 
available only to the organization's users. It is generally considered a
 more secure solution and provides dedicated rather than shared 
computing and networking resources for the organization. Since the 
organization owns this cloud, scaling up or down can be difficult, 
time-consuming, and costly, but it can still be done if necessary.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m22-135"><b><i>Public Cloud</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m22-136">The public cloud works on a shared infrastructure 
where services provided are rendered over the Internet. Basic public 
cloud services are often free, but additional resources and features may
 be purchased, either through a subscription or a pay-per-use fee. A 
public cloud allows you to scale your infrastructure as and when 
required, resulting in a solution that is almost always less costly than
 a private cloud. However, public clouds are generally considered to be a
 less secure cloud model.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m22-137"><b><i>Hybrid Cloud</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m22-138">A hybrid cloud delivery model is a composition of two
 or more clouds where at least one is private and at least one is 
public. These clouds remain distinct entities but are bound together, 
offering the benefits of multiple deployment models.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-139">For example, an organization can host database 
servers in a private cloud, while the Web servers are hosted in a 
third-party shared cloud environment. The database servers typically 
store sensitive information and, therefore, need to be hosted on the 
private cloud. The front-end of the database servers, which is the Web 
site or Web application, is hosted on the public cloud for ease of 
scalability.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m22-140"><b><i>Community Cloud</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m22-141">In a community cloud, users share the same set of 
data and resources. It is accessed by multiple parties. For example, 
cloud deployed for the students at a university or a college would 
normally be a community cloud - accessed by all the students.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-142"><b>Cloud Service Providers</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-143">In a cloud environment, there are two main roles: CSP
 and cloud consumers. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are organizations 
that provide cloud services to consumers. The CSP is responsible for 
providing services as well as maintaining the infrastructure and 
providing security. The cloud consumer uses the cloud infrastructure and
 pays a fee to the CSP.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-144">The services provided to the user by the CSP vary 
with the model of cloud involved. For example, in the SaaS environment, 
the CSP delivers software to the cloud consumer. In the PaaS model, the 
CSP provides the platform while the applications and data are the 
responsibility of the cloud consumer. Similarly, in IaaS, the CSP 
provides only a virtualized environment. The operating system, 
middleware, runtime, data, and applications all are the cloud consumer's
 responsibility.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-145"><b>Managed Service Provider (MSP) / Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-146">In a typical enterprise scenario, a technical team is
 needed to manage the network, servers, and systems. For the 
organization, it is a cost as well as HR overhead to hire and maintain 
the team. Organizations have started outsourcing these technical 
services to third-parties, known as Managed Service Providers (MSP). 
MSPs manage the network, servers, and systems and provide active support
 for the IT functions. Most MSPs focus on a specific set of 
technologies, such as Microsoft or Linux. Payment models for these 
services are normally pay-per-resource or a monthly-subscription-fee.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-147">A Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)&nbsp;helps
 an organization maintain a secure digital environment. Like MSP, an 
MSSP focuses on security services, applications, and devices. An MSSP is
 not involved in day-to-day IT functions. Instead, it focuses on 
managing and maintaining the organization's network and data security. 
An MSSP focuses on the complete management and implementation of 
security applications, such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP), or security 
appliances, such as firewall, Intrusion Detection System (IDS), 
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) and anti-malware applications.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-148"><b>On-premises vs. Off-premises</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-149">Digital infrastructure can either be on-premise or 
off-premise. In earlier days, most organizations hosted their 
datacenters on-premise. In such cases, the organization has complete 
control over the infrastructure. They can control access to the servers,
 easily customize the infrastructure, and quickly cater to evolving 
business demands. Moreover, on-premise datacenters are more economical 
to maintain.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-150">However, the on-premise datacenters present some 
demands - an upfront financial cost of setting up the datacenter, time 
and effort to set up the datacenter, and a skilled workforce to maintain
 the infrastructure.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-151">Off-premise datacenters host their servers with a 
third party. For example, cloud computing. Off-premise datacenters offer
 benefits such as no upfront setup fee, no maintenance cost, and 
automatic upgrades of the applications and hardware.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-152">However, off-premise datacenters do present some 
disadvantages. One of the fundamental disadvantages is that the security
 applied to the data is at the third-party’s discretion. Moreover, the 
organization does not have control over the infrastructure. Also, you 
must always have an Internet connection to access the infrastructure.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-153"><b>Edge Computing</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-154">Edge computing is a concept that is now evolving. As 
compared to mobile computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), edge 
computing works on decentralized architecture. In decentralized 
architecture, each device processes data on its own rather than sending 
it to a centralized server.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-155">In edge computing, data is processed where it 
originates. Mobiles, laptops, IoT devices, and tablets are the primary 
devices that generate data. Data is processed on these devices, and this
 brings efficiency in using these resources. Moreover, as the devices 
process the data themselves:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-156">

<li id="cn-m22-156">Devices do not need to be connected to a corporate network all the time</li>

<li id="cn-m22-157">There is no latency of data transmission</li>

<li id="cn-m22-158">There is no dependency on a single centralized server</li>

<li id="cn-m22-159">The centralized server does not become a response-bottleneck</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m22-160">It is also important to note that sometimes edge 
computing and IoT are incorrectly considered synonyms of each other. As 
stated earlier, the data-generating devices process the data themselves.
 On the other hand, the IoT devices are connected to a centralized 
server that processes the device requests and queries. This introduces 
latency issues.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-161"><b>Fog Computing</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-162">Fog computing allows you to specify the data to be 
processed locally, and the data to be pushed to cloud for centralized 
processing. This specification is governed by the business requirements 
of the organization.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-163">The limited amount of data going out of the network 
to the cloud reduces the bandwidth requirement. Further, in case there 
is no bandwidth available, the data can still be processed on the device
 where the data originated.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-164"><b>Thin Client</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-165">A system would have enough storage, memory, and CPU 
power to run various applications in a normal scenario. However, this is
 not the case for thin clients that have limited resources. A thin 
client connects to a central server where all the processing takes 
place. A server has enough resources to support several thin clients as 
well as run various applications.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-166">Clients connect to the server using the Remote 
Desktop Protocol and work directly on the server. Using thin clients 
offers various benefits, such as users cannot install unauthorized 
applications on the server or thin clients, data cannot be moved out of 
the server unless permitted by the administrator. Moreover, thin clients
 are easy to manage as no applications are running on them, and all 
policies are deployed on the centralized server.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-167"><b>Containers</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-168">Containers work on the concept of compartments. You 
can deploy multiple containers on a single host, and each container can 
run different applications. An important feature of containers is that 
the operating system is the same for all the containers on a single 
physical host. This contrasts with the virtual machine that can run 
different operating systems on the same physical machine. To run 
containers with different operating systems, you need to deploy them on 
different physical hosts with different operating systems.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-169">Containers enable you to have native performance for 
an application. Since a container runs a part of the operating system, 
there is generally less overhead, and you get good performance from the 
hosted application.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-170">Containers are quick to create, lightweight, and 
start as soon as the operating system boots. This avoids any latency in 
setting up and running applications.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-171">However, the operating system being the same on all 
the containers on a physical system introduces the disadvantage that any
 vulnerability in the OS kernel affects each container running on the 
operating system.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-172">A container consists of four layers, in the following order:</p>

<p id="cn-m22-173">1. Operating system</p>

<p id="cn-m22-174">2. Container engine</p>

<p id="cn-m22-175">3. Binaries and libraries</p>

<p id="cn-m22-176">4. Application</p>

<p id="cn-m22-177">Fundamental differences between virtualization and containerization include:</p>

<p id="cn-m22-178"><b>Speed</b>: Containers start with the operating 
system as it is loaded. Therefore, the start is immediate. However, 
virtual machines need to load the complete operating system which will 
affect the start-up time of the virtual machines.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-179"><b>Resources</b>: Containers start immediately with 
the operating system, and therefore, there is little system resource 
consumption. For example, a container consumes a small portion of memory
 on startup. On the other hand, there can be multiple virtual machines 
running on a single physical host, and each virtual machine requires its
 share of system resources. This can overload the physical server, which
 ultimately impacts the functionality of the virtual machines.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-180"><b>Security and isolation</b>: Containers run within 
the operating system. The containers can isolate the applications and 
their data only at the process level, and they are less secure. On the 
other hand, virtual machines run separately and in isolation. Therefore,
 virtual machines are more secure than containers. If the operating 
system is compromised, then all the containers can also be compromised. 
This, however, is not true for various virtual machines running on a 
physical machine.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-181"><b>Portability</b>: Containers are much smaller in 
size, and therefore, they are easy to port. Porting a virtual machine 
includes porting configuration files and libraries as well. Therefore, 
the porting size of the virtual machines can be much larger, and 
potentially a problem.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-182"><b>Operating system</b>: A virtual machine can run an
 independent operating system on a physical host. Containers can run 
only the operating system that the host is running.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-183"><b>Microservices/API</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-184">Microservices is an architectural pattern that allows
 you to develop applications using different independent services. These
 services are loosely coupled, meaning that they do not have 
dependencies on each other. They can be independently deployed with 
different software. For example, a single API can be used with more than
 one software application. It could be integrated with an internal human
 resource software application or with a payroll software application, 
depending on the requirement. These services are mostly developed to 
meet specific business objectives.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-185">To develop a complex application rapidly and 
reliably, you can put together a set of services based on different 
technologies and programming languages. With the use of microservices, 
the data is not centrally controlled. Rather, the data is decentralized 
in which each of the services can use its storage mechanism and type 
individually and will not be reliant on other resources to function.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m22-186"><b><i>Application Programming Interface (API)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m22-187">An API is an interface that allows two different 
applications to connect and share data. There are primarily two types of
 APIs used for this purpose:</p>

<p id="cn-m22-188"><b>Representational State Transfer (REST)</b></p>

<p id="cn-m22-189">Representational State Transfer (REST) is an 
architectural style or API used with Web applications, mobile apps, 
games, or anything that runs on the Internet. It uses stateless calls, 
which means that it does not store client/server context. It can also 
work with different formats, such as JSON, XML, and HTML. It provides 
improved performance by using cacheable responses, which reduces the 
number of calls made to the server.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-190"><b>Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) </b></p>

<p id="cn-m22-191">SOAP is a protocol or API that is primarily used for 
data exchange. It is driven by a set of rules that must be adhered to 
for an interaction between two entities. It can be accessed via various 
protocols, such as HTTP, SMTP, and TCP. It can only use XML, unlike REST
 that can use various formats. A SOAP request cannot be cached, and 
therefore, for every request, interaction needs to occur, and there is 
more consumption of bandwidth and system resources.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-192"><b>Infrastructure as Code</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-193">To develop an application, you first set up the 
infrastructure. Setting up the infrastructure is normally a 
time-consuming activity and could include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-194">

<li id="cn-m22-194">Setting up and managing servers</li>

<li id="cn-m22-195">Installing and configuring operating systems</li>

<li id="cn-m22-196">Configuring database connections</li>

<li id="cn-m22-197">Configuring storage</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m22-198">Infrastructure as code (IaC) helps bring automation 
in provisioning the IT infrastructure. IaC is a high-level descriptive 
coding language that automates setting up the entire infrastructure. 
This means you do not have to manually setup or provision the IT 
infrastructure.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-199">When developing an application, all these tasks are 
performed repeatedly. You not only lose time, but there can also be 
consistency issues. IaC helps provision the infrastructure with speed, 
consistency, and lower cost.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-200">Examples of IaC include:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-201">

<li id="cn-m22-201">AWS CloudFormation</li>

<li id="cn-m22-202">Red Hat Ansible</li>

<li id="cn-m22-203">Chef</li>

<li id="cn-m22-204">Puppet</li>

<li id="cn-m22-205">SaltStack</li>

<li id="cn-m22-206">HashiCorp Terraform</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m22-207"><b><i>Software-Defined Networking (SDN)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m22-208">Networks can be large and complex, making them 
difficult to manage. Software-Defining Networking (SDN) enables you to 
program such networks for the ease of management. You can use specific 
applications to control and manage the networks without worrying about 
the technologies that are used to make up the network. In simpler terms,
 it could be any underlying technology that runs the network, then you 
can simply control the network with specific applications.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-209">To be able to able to manage and control the network,
 you need to program the network functionality and behavior. This is 
done through specific applications that use APIs.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-210">One big advantage of SDN is openness, as it allows 
you to integrate technologies from different vendors and use them on the
 network without adding any complexity.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m22-211"><b><i>Software-Defined Visibility (SDV)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m22-212">In a large and complex network, you would have 
several security appliances, devices, and applications. Some of these 
could be an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Intrusion Detection 
System (IDS), firewall, or a Web Application Firewall (WAF). Along with 
this, organizations use a multi-tiered approach by implementing security
 information and event management systems (SIEM). However, the problem 
with these is that they can only monitor the traffic that they see.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-213">There can be certain parts of the network that are 
considered blind spots, which means that they are not being monitored. 
This type of issue is resolved with SDV, which helps you 
programmatically integrate your security tools and applications. They 
can be programmed to report the anomalies in the traffic to a central 
location so that the visibility can be expanded.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-214"><b>Serverless Architecture</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-215">Serverless architecture, also known as Function As A 
Service (FaaS), is based on the cloud. The developer does not have to 
set up the infrastructure, which is completely managed and handled by 
the cloud service provider. The developer can focus on developing the 
application rather than spending time setting up the infrastructure. 
With the serverless technology, the applications are built directly in 
the cloud environment. The applications run on the servers as they do in
 the on-premises infrastructure, however, without the developer worrying
 about the underlying infrastructure. As and when required, there is 
automatic provisioning and scaling of the underlying infrastructure.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-216">There is often confusion between PaaS and FaaS. Both 
of these services are based on the concept of running an application in 
the cloud. However, the underlying architectures are fundamentally 
different. In PaaS, the entire application is run as a single unit, 
which means that the scaling is done at the application level. However, 
in FaaS, the scaling is done at the function level because it is 
composed at the function level. As and when required, the functions can 
be scaled individually. This saves many system resources, because only 
selected functions might be consuming more resources than the others.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-217">An existing application will need to be architected 
again to run as small independent functions. Serverless architecture is 
good to use when you have a limited number of functions.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-218"><b>Services Integration</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-219">An organization may need to use various services from
 different service providers to meet business requirements. Coordinating
 these services can be a difficult task. For ease of managing the 
services, the organization can implement service integration. 
Integrating services enables the organization to manage them using a 
single interface.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-220">The Service Integration and Management (SIAM) model 
helps the organization apply the required governance and management to 
these services. SIAM intends to bring in integration and collaboration 
amongst the suppliers so that each one of them knows their roles, 
responsibilities, and deliverables.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-221">As an example of implementing the SIAM model, an 
organization may have to integrate services from say, the Internet 
Service Provider (ISP) and the Cloud Service Provider (CSP).</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-222"><b>Resource Policies</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-223">A resource policy defines access to the resources on a
 network. A resource can be a file, folder, server, or even a specific 
service. An administrator can configure a resource policy to either 
allow or deny access to a user or a group of users. Applying the 
resource policy grants specified rights to the user or the group.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-224">There can be different types of resource policies. 
For example, a Web resource policy can allow or deny access to users on a
 Web resource. Similarly, an Email resource policy could prevent a user 
from opening certain attachments.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-225"><b>Transit Gateway</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-226">A transit gateway is a communication hub that is 
required to interconnect two clouds or an on-premise data center to a 
cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-227">Various interfaces are available to create and manage
 a transit gateway. For example, when working with Amazon AWS, you can 
set up a transit gateway, which allows not only the ease of 
connectivity, but also allows you to manage the network connections 
using a central console. Another benefit of using an AWS transit gateway
 is security. The transit gateway on Amazon AWS remains within the cloud
 and is not exposed on the Internet.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m22-228"><b>Virtualization</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m22-229">A physical system contains physical resources, such 
as CPU, memory, network adapter, and storage. An operating system uses 
these resources to run on the system. However, only one operating system
 can run per physical system.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-230">Virtualization, on the other hand, enables multiple 
virtual systems to run on a single physical machine. This is because it 
allows a single processor on the server to act as multiple processors. 
Similarly, virtualization allows the physical resources of a system to 
be emulated as multiple virtual systems. The multiple virtual machines 
running on a system are isolated from each other.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-231">Each virtual machine works like a normal system, 
except that it does not have any physical hardware. Hypervisor is a 
software application, that is required on the physical machine to create
 and manage virtual machines. A hypervisor enables multiple operating 
systems to run in parallel and virtually share the system resources. 
These operating systems run within a shell known as a virtual machine. 
The virtual machine is a guest computer that has the specified operating
 system and the specified virtual hardware. Hypervisor enables you to 
edit and customize the virtual machine settings.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m22-235"><b><i>Virtual Machine (VM) Sprawl Avoidance</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m22-236">VM sprawl occurs when there are too many virtual 
machines without any kind of proper control or management. Some virtual 
machines may be running, but then there are others that are in an idle 
state and have not been used for a long time. VM sprawl is a common 
issue faced by virtual machine administrators. There are no fixed 
methods to control the virtual machine sprawl, but the following best 
practices can be used:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-237">

<li id="cn-m22-237">Create a library of virtual machine images</li>

<li id="cn-m22-238">Use Virtual Machine Life Cycle Management Tool</li>

<li id="cn-m22-239">Limit the permission for the creation of virtual machines</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m22-240">Shutting down virtual machines does not reduce VM sprawl.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m22-241"><b><i>VM Escape Protection</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m22-242">VM escape is a vulnerability that enables an attacker
 to gain direct access to the host operating system and interact with 
the system's hypervisor. Gaining access to these resources will enable 
the attacker to perform specific administrative tasks, including 
creating and deleting virtual machines. In addition to that, the 
attacker will also be able to modify the privileges of the compromised 
virtual machine.</p>

<p id="cn-m22-243">To prevent VM escape, the following can be implemented:</p>

<ul id="cn-m22-244">

<li id="cn-m22-244">Ensure the virtual machine’s software is up to date</li>

<li id="cn-m22-245">Install only trusted and required software on the virtual machines</li>

<li id="cn-m22-246">Use best practices to harden to virtual machine against attacks</li>

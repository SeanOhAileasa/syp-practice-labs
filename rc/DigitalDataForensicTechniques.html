<h3 id="cn-m29-70"><b>Motive, Opportunity and Means</b></h3>

<h4 id="cn-m29-71"><b><i>Motive</i></b></h4>

<ul id="cn-m29-72">

<li id="cn-m29-72">Who was responsible for the crime? Considering the 
motive of a crime (why the crime was committed), is a significant piece 
in figuring out who would participate in such an activity.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-73">Maybe the perpetrator was persuaded by either internal or external conditions.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m29-74"><b><i>Opportunity</i></b></h4>

<ul id="cn-m29-75">

<li id="cn-m29-75">Where and when was the crime committed?</li>

<li id="cn-m29-76">Prospects generally arise when certain vulnerabilities or weaknesses are present.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m29-77"><b><i>Means</i></b></h4>

<ul id="cn-m29-78">

<li id="cn-m29-78">Refers to the method that was used to commit the 
crime. In cybersecurity, it may refer to the attack method that was used
 to compromise the resource.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m29-79"><b>Documentation/Evidence</b></h3>

<h4 id="cn-m29-80"><b><i>Legal Hold</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-81">A legal hold is a process that an organization might 
use to contain all relevant data when litigation is expected. The legal 
hold process is usually initiated by a communication from legal counsel 
to an organization to suspend the normal disposal of records, such as 
the recycling of tape backups or the archiving or deletion of data.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-82"><b><i>Chain of Custody</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-83">In scenarios where evidence might be used in civil or 
criminal litigation, an organization needs to establish a chain of 
custody; otherwise known as a chain of evidence, which documents the 
location of the evidence from the moment it is collected to the moment 
it appears in court. This can include the police who collect it, the 
evidence technicians who process it and the lawyers who use it in court.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-84">Chain of custody has the following information:</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-85">

<li id="cn-m29-85">A data history displays how evidence was written, examined, transported, and stored to be presented in court.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-86">Chain of custody should follow evidence till the end</li>

<li id="cn-m29-87">Copies of data made as required must be tamper-proof</li>

<li id="cn-m29-88">Chain of custody evidence commands that all evidence be categorized with information representing who secured and validated it.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-89">Magnetic disk surfaces ought not to be marked on.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-90">The most common reason for inappropriate evidence 
collection is the absence of an established incident response team, lack
 of an established incident response process, badly written policy or a 
broken chain of custody.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-91">Dead forensics - when the examination is done on static data in a lab</li>

<li id="cn-m29-92">Live forensics - when the examination is done in-field and includes volatile data.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m29-93"><b><i>Computer Criminal Behaviour</i></b></h4>

<ul id="cn-m29-94">

<li id="cn-m29-94">Psychological crime scene review (profiling) can also be piloted using the criminalâ€™s MO and signature behaviors.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-95">Profiling offers insight into the attacker's attack 
pattern and can be used to identify the attacker or at the very least, 
the tool used for the crime.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-96">Locardâ€™s Exchange principle mentions that the 
criminal or the attacker leaves some information behind at the crime 
scene and takes something with them.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m29-97"><b><i>Forensic Process Best Practices</i></b></h4>

<ul id="cn-m29-98">

<li id="cn-m29-98">The original image needs to be a bit-level copy, 
sector by sector, to capture destroyed files, slack spaces and 
unallocated clusters.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-99">The original image is called the source or the primary image, which must be kept in a library.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-100">The forensic investigator should only work from a copy of the source image called the secondary image.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-101">The images should be timestamped to show when the data was gathered.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-102">Before moving the images to a media location, it is vital to confirm the destination has enough space and is secure.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m29-103"><b>Data Acquisition</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m29-104">Based on the type of media, there are various methods an organization can use to retrieve data for forensic analysis purposes.</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-105">

<li id="cn-m29-105"><b>Capture system image </b>- When capturing a 
system image, an organization will create an exact sector-level 
duplicate of the media. Typically, the duplicate is created using a hard
 drive duplicator or software imaging tool that mirrors the block level 
data.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-106"><b>Network traffic and logs </b>-  As part of 
network forensics, an organization might observe and analyze computer 
traffic to detect intrusions and data collection, or as part of the 
evidence in litigation. An organization might also use network sniffing,
 recording, acquisition, and monitoring network traffic and event logs 
to examine a network security incident.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-107"><b>Capture video </b>- When capturing video and/or 
audio for forensic review, an organization needs to understand how the 
system records the data (e.g., digital or analog) and the choices 
available to obtain the data (e.g., CD/DVD writing, USB, etc.)</li>

<li id="cn-m29-108"><b>Record time offset </b>- During the playback of a
 system image, media or data, an organization needs to understand the 
time offset of when the information was recorded (e.g., time zone). The 
time offset is typically logged when capturing the data to ensure that 
investigators account for the difference when reviewing the information 
later.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-109"><b>Take hashes </b>- After an image is captured, it 
is typically verified at critical points throughout the analysis to 
ensure that the evidence is still in its original state. This 
verification typically includes using the SHA-1 or MD5 hash functions. 
The process in which an image is verified with a hash function is called
 hashing.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-110"><b>Screenshots </b>- In some scenarios, it can be 
necessary to capture information for forensic analysis using 
screenshots. Typically, these are still image captures of information on
 a computer monitor. This is commonly used in less-critical forensic 
analysis or scenarios when capturing a system image, media, or data is 
not available.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-111"><b>Witness interviews </b>- Many times during 
forensic analysis, it is important to interview or depose individuals 
who might have direct knowledge related to the incident. This can 
include individuals responsible for the systems or network devices that 
were compromised or individuals who might have information about the 
attack.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m29-112"><b><i>Order of Volatility</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-113">The order of volatility is the order in which an 
organization should collect forensic evidence. Since highly volatile 
data can be easily lost, the most volatile data should be collected 
first and the least volatile data should be collected last. For example,
 an organization might choose the following order; physical memory, 
virtual memory, disk drives, backups and printouts. This is the order of
 volatility of the data that needs to be investigated.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-114"><b><i>Firmware</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-115">Firmware is software preserved on a ROM chip. At the 
system level, it contains the basic commands needed to start a computer.
 Firmware is also used to provide operating commands in peripheral 
devices such as printers.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-116"><b><i>Snapshots</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-117">A snapshot is a copy of an application, disk or 
system. Typically, an organization will use a snapshot to restore a 
system or disk to a specific time. However, a snapshot is not commonly 
used as a periodic backup strategy because of the amount of backup time 
and backup storage required.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-118">Snapshots can be made of a system where a forensic 
investigation is performed. By creating a snapshot of the system, the 
original system is preserved.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m29-119"><b>On-Premises vs. Cloud </b></h3>

<p id="cn-m29-120">Forensic data investigation for data situated in the 
cloud differs significantly from data stored on on-premise 
infrastructure. Several different dependencies are quired for a forensic
 investigation. These include the Cloud Service Provider (CSP), which 
hosts the data. After a cybersecurity incident has occurred, the legal 
jurisdiction and the laws that govern that specific region need to be 
considered before the investigation is conducted.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-121">A company can choose where the data must be stored and be careful when selecting it as it might pertain to different data laws.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-122">Maintaining a chain of custody for data stored in the
 cloud is more challenging than the traditional on-premise storage as 
the control of the data penultimately lies with the Cloud Service 
Provider(CSP), which can create its unique challenges.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-123"><b><i>Right to Audit Clauses</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-124">An&nbsp;audit clause&nbsp;is basically an agreement 
to deliver documents. Usually, it gives a principal the&nbsp;right to 
"audit" a contractor's books and records, given the contractor's 
compliance with its obligations within the contract.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-125"><b><i>Data Breach Notification Laws</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-126">HITECHâ€™s (Health Information Technology for Economic 
and Clinical Health Act of 2009) data breach notification rule is 
distinct. It is a federal law mandating the notification of affected 
persons.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-127">Personally identifiable information includes:</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-128">

<li id="cn-m29-128">Social Security number</li>

<li id="cn-m29-129">Driverâ€™s license number</li>

<li id="cn-m29-130">State identification card number</li>

<li id="cn-m29-131">Credit or debit card number</li>

<li id="cn-m29-132">Bank account number with the security code, access code, or password that would permit access to the account</li>

<li id="cn-m29-133">Medical records</li>

<li id="cn-m29-134">Health insurance information</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m29-135">Data breach notification laws contain policies 
relating to the application of these laws. These laws entail entities 
that have been subjected to a breach to communicate with the individuals
 whose data was breached and other appropriate parties and inform them 
about the incident.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-137">These laws contain the manner in which notification 
needs to occur, the time limit for these notifications, people, agencies
 and authorities that must be contacted about the breach. It is required
 that data processors are to notify data controllers within 72 hours of a
 breach, and the information controllers are required to inform the 
supervisory data protection authority as soon as possible.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-139">Data breach notification laws also contain exceptions
 to the notice requirement. For example, under the GDPR, notification of
 the data breach is dependent on the severity of the breach. Few data 
breach notification laws do not necessitate notification if it is 
identified that the breach will not harm the affected parties. In other 
laws, notification occurs when a threshold is reached.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m29-140"><b>Integrity</b></h3>

<h4 id="cn-m29-141"><b><i>Hashing</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-142">A hashing algorithm is a mathematical function that 
maps data of different sizes to a hash of a fixed size. The purpose of a
 hash function is to be a one-way function, impossible to go back. In 
reality, the public key used in asymmetric encryption is based on a hash
 value â€” the value is calculated from a base input number using a 
hashing algorithm.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-143">Various cryptographic hashing algorithms can be used to produce a checksum value. A <b>checksum </b>value
 is a small piece of data derived from the data being protected. The 
primary purpose of the checksum is to validate the authenticity of the 
data.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-144"><b>MD5</b></p>

<p id="cn-m29-145">The Message-Digest algorithm 5 (MD5) is one of the 
two most widely used hashing algorithms. The function takes an input of 
arbitrary length and produces a message digest that is 128 bits long 
(i.e., a 128-bit hash value), typically rendered as a 32-digit 
hexadecimal number. MD5 has been known to cause collisions (i.e., two 
distinct messages that hash to the same value). However, it can still be
 used as a checksum to verify data integrity, such as verifying 
unintentional corruption or determining the partition for a particular 
key in a partitioned database.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-146"><b>SHA</b></p>

<p id="cn-m29-147">The other one of the two most extensively used 
hashing algorithms, the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), is the common 
standard used for generating digital signatures. SHA was invented by the
 NSA. SHA-1 takes an input and the output is a 160 bit hash value. The 
outcome of SHA-2 is 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-148"><b>HMAC</b></p>

<p id="cn-m29-149">Hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) 
validates the data integrity and the authentication of a text. Because 
HMAC uses two passes of hash computation, the algorithm offers better 
protection against attacks.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-150"><b>RIPEMD</b></p>

<p id="cn-m29-151">European researchers established RACE Integrity 
Primitives Evaluation Message Digest (RIPEMD); the design is based on 
the MD5 hashing algorithm. One of the current versions, RIPEMD-160, is 
an advanced version of RIPEMD. The performance of the algorithm is 
comparable to SHA. RIPEMD is available in 128, 256 and 320-bit versions.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-152"><b><i>Digital Signature</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-153">The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is considered a
 standard for digital signatures. The digital signature provides message
 authentication, integrity and non-repudiation. DSA creates the digital 
signature by using unique mathematical functions involving two 160-bit 
numbers. These numbers originate from the message digests (strings of 
digits created by a one-way hashing formula) and the private key. While 
the signerâ€™s private key signs messages, the digital signature is 
verified by the signerâ€™s corresponding public key. DSA uses the public 
key only for authentication, not for encrypting or decrypting messages.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-154"><b><i>Data Provenance&nbsp;</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-155">Data Provenance denotes records of the inputs, 
entities, systems, and processes that influence&nbsp;interest data, 
offering a historical record of the&nbsp;data&nbsp;and its origins.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m29-156"><b>Preservation</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m29-157">After data is captured, it has to be preserved as 
evidence. While various laws cover the seizure and preservation of data,
 law enforcement personnel will often perform this in criminal cases, as
 mandated by a warrant. However, in civil litigation it will typically 
be an officer within the organization. It is assumed that a company is 
able to investigate their own equipment without a warrant.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-158">Preservation of the captured data ensures that 
potentially discoverable information is protected against alteration or 
deletion, thus hindering the investigation.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-159">When evidence is collected and labeled to preserve the chain of custody, the label should include the following information:</p>

<ul id="cn-m29-160">

<li id="cn-m29-160">General description of the evidence.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-161">Time and date the evidence was collected.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-162">Exact location the evidence was collected from.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-163">Name of the person collecting the evidence.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-164">Relevant circumstances surrounding the collection.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-165">Each person who handles the evidence needs to sign 
the chain of custody log indicating the time in which they took direct 
responsibility for the evidence and when they handed it to the next 
person.</li>

<li id="cn-m29-166">The chain of custody must provide an unbroken 
sequence of events relating to the evidence from the time it was 
collected until the trial.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m29-167"><b>E-Discovery</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m29-168">Process of producing for a court or external attorney
 all ESI (Electronically Stored Information) pertinent to a legal 
proceeding.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-169">The eDiscovery process includes information 
governance, identification, preservation, collection, processing, 
review, analysis, production, and presentation activities.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m29-173"><b>Recovery</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m29-174">Many times during a forensic analysis, it may be 
necessary to recover information that has been intentionally or 
mistakenly deleted. The investigator is responsible for recovering as 
much evidence as possible using various tools or methodologies. The 
types of data recovered can vary depending on the investigation, but 
examples include chat logs, emails, documents, images or internet 
history. This data might be recovered from accessible disk space, 
deleted (or unallocated) space or the operating systemâ€™s cache files.</p>

<p id="cn-m29-176">Provided only by public key (or asymmetric) 
cryptosystems, non-repudiation assures the recipient that the message 
was originated by the sender. It prevents the sender from claiming they 
did not send the message (also known as repudiating the message).</p>

<h3 id="cn-m29-177"><b>Strategic Intelligence/Counterintelligence Gathering</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m29-178">Strategic intelligence is collecting, processing, 
analyzing, and disseminating intelligence information for formulating 
policy and military plans at the international and national policy 
levels. In the commercial world, this information is used to build 
qualities that enable leaders to be effective strategists. The 
intelligence information gathered in counterintelligence is for 
protecting an organizationâ€™s intelligence program against an attacker or
 the oppositionâ€™s intelligence service. The information gathered can be 
used for forensic analysis, counter-espionage or sabotage.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m29-179"><b><i>Active Logging</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m29-180">During counterintelligence gathering, it might be 
necessary for an organization to maintain active logs of the opposition 
or attacker's activity.</p>

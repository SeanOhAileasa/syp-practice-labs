<div class="print-exercise-break"></div><h2 class="exercise-title" id="cn-m5-74"><b>Exercise 1 - Importance of Security Concepts in an Enterprise Environment</b></h2>

<p id="cn-m5-75">Enterprise networks are usually large and complex. More
 devices that you add on to them, more complexity is added. With the 
enterprise network, it is critical to ensure highest levels of security.
 You need to have security controls that are updated on regular basis to
 ensure optimal security.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-76">There are different methods that can add security on to
 a network environment. For example, having a redundant site also 
ensures that the redundant site is available even if the primary site 
goes down. This is also part of the security, which is included in the 
CIA triad. With the redundant site you ensure availability, which is a 
critical aspect of security.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-77">In this exercise, you will learn about various important security concepts in an enterprise environment.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-94"><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m5-c-1" src="EnterpriseNetworkSecurityConfigurationConcepts_files/image-m5-c-1.jpg" alt="Practice Labs screenshot."></p>

<h3 id="cn-m5-96"><b>Configuration Management</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-97">Most organizations define a specific configuration for 
the endpoints and servers. Keeping the configuration in the desired 
state is known as configuration management. The organization, with the 
configuration management process, can monitor and manage their systems 
in a better way. For example, you roll out Windows operating system on 
all endpoints with only Office 365. It is easy for you to track. This is
 the configuration management process.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-98">A user may need to install another application. As part
 of the configuration management process, you need to approve this 
change and document it. The change is now documented and can be tracked.
 You can perform configuration management in a manual way or use a 
third-party application to track the changes that are made to the system
 configuration or if any unauthorized application is installed.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-99">In the configuration management process, each endpoint,
 server, or device is known as configuration items, which are tracked 
using Configuration Management Database (CMDB).</p>

<p id="cn-m5-100">Several other components play a key role in configuration management. Some of the key components are described below.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-101"><b><i>Network Diagrams</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-102">A network topology diagram is a visual depiction of a 
network architecture. It uses different symbols and connections, which 
are represented by lines. A network diagram can help a user understand 
the layout of the network.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-103">The network topology diagram should detail out how the network is designed. It should mention the following (at minimum):</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-104">

<li id="cn-m5-104">Devices that are present on the network</li>

<li id="cn-m5-105">Connectivity between these devices</li>

<li id="cn-m5-106">IP addresses and names of these devices</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m5-107">Assume a situation in which you have joined an 
organization as Network Administrator. You have been asked to 
troubleshoot a network problem. Without the help of a network diagram, 
it would take you a while to understand the network architecture. 
However, if the network diagram is available, you can visualize the 
problem quickly.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-108">It is also important to note that network diagrams are
 not static. As new devices are added or removed from the network, you 
should update the corresponding  diagram. Even if an IP address of a 
server has changed, you should update it on the diagram.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-109"><b><i>Baseline Configuration</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-110">A baseline configuration is based on the configuration
 parameters that have been set in an operating system. These parameters 
define what is installed in the operating system. A baseline 
configuration, once approved and rolled out, serves as a base on which 
changes can be implemented.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-111">Before a baseline configuration is rolled out, it is 
defined with clear parameters and then tested. For example, an 
organization may have a separate baseline for desktops, another one for 
laptops, and a third one for the servers. When the baseline 
configuration is created, it is tested for stability and security. Once 
approved, the baseline configuration is rolled out on the systems and 
servers.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-112">An administrator monitors systems and servers against 
the defined baseline. If a user installs a third-party application 
without the approval from the administrator, it is known as baseline 
configuration deviation.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-113"><b><i>Standard Naming Conventions</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-114">An organization can follow a specific naming convention for users, groups, endpoints, servers, and network devices. For example:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-115">

<li id="cn-m5-115"><b>Users</b>: It can be combination of first name and
 first letter of surname. For example, Josh Fairbanks account can be 
joshf@practicelabs.com<b>. </b>Alternatively, you can also have 
josh.fairbanks@practicelabs.com. Some organizations may follow another 
convention, which is the first letter of the first name and then the 
surname, jfairbanks@practice-labs.com<b>.</b></li>

<li id="cn-m5-116"><b>Groups</b>: Just like the usernames, there is no fixed convention. An organization may simply name the groups as <b>plabmarketing </b>or <b>plabsales</b>.</li>

<li id="cn-m5-117"><b>Servers</b>: Servers are critical and need to be 
clearly distinguished between the testing, development, and production 
servers. For example, a testing webserver may be named as <b>plab-test-web</b>. In the similar manner, a production webserver can be named as <b>plab-prod-web</b>.</li>

<li id="cn-m5-118"><b>Endpoints</b>: The endpoints may be named after 
their groups, departments, or can even follow a specific series that is 
defined for tracking assets. For example, <b>plab-mkt-josh </b>or <b>plab-ep-001</b>.</li>

<li id="cn-m5-119"><b>Network Devices</b>: They can also be named using a specific convention, such as <b>plab-prod-wap1</b>.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m5-120">There is no specific rule about which naming 
convention an organization must follow. It depends on how you want to 
track user and group accounts or any other devices on the network. 
However, it is critical that one convention is used throughout for all 
users. Similarly, one convention for groups. Another convention can be 
used for servers, endpoints, and network devices.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-121"><b><i>Internet Protocol (IP) Schema</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-122">Network configuration management is a subset of the 
configuration management process. In network configuration management, 
you have to keep track of network devices, their configurations, and IP 
schema that is being used. It is essential for an organization to use a 
specific IP schema and manage it through the DHCP server.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-123">It is good practice to define different IP addresses 
for servers and network devices. These are assigned static IP addresses.
 Endpoints are also assigned IP addresses from pools configured on the 
DHCP server.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-124">When dealing with a large network with thousands of 
endpoints, servers, and network devices, it is critical for the 
administrator to plan the entire IP schema carefully to avoid:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-125">

<li id="cn-m5-125">Wastage of IP addresses</li>

<li id="cn-m5-126">Duplicate subnets</li>

<li id="cn-m5-127">Duplicate IP addresses</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m5-128"><b>Data Sovereignty</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-129">Each country has their data sovereignty laws, and data
 sovereignty refers to maintaining the data privacy. The country’s laws 
specify where the information is being stored and how it is shared and 
handled. For an organization to work in a global environment, multiple 
offices in different countries, data sovereignty must be considered.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-130">Let’s consider an example of a virtual machine in the 
cloud environment. When moving a virtual machine from one geographic 
location to another geographic location in a different country, you may 
face the data sovereignty issues. Each country has their data privacy 
laws. The data residing inside the virtual machine must comply with the 
laws of the country where you are moving the virtual machine.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m5-131"><b>Data Protection</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-132">Data security is critical to protecting data. When you
 refer to the data security, you are essentially referring to 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of the data.</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-133">

<li id="cn-m5-133"><b>Confidentiality </b>- Protecting the data from falling into the wrong hands and providing access only on the need to know basis.</li>

<li id="cn-m5-134"><b>Integrity </b>- Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of the data. It is about protecting the data from any kind of tampering.</li>

<li id="cn-m5-135"><b>Availability </b>- Making the data available as 
and when required. It is about ensuring that the data is available as 
and when authorized personnel need to access it.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m5-136">There are different methods that can be used to 
protect the CIA of data within the organization. For example, you can 
implement encryption to protect the confidentiality of the data. 
Similarly, a method like replication or fault tolerance can provide 
availability.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-137">Let’s look at some of the methods for data protection.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-138"><b><i>Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-139">Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a set of rules that are 
defined to protect confidential and sensitive information. DLP, as an 
application, contains several rules that help you define the type of 
data that the users can share. For example, within an organization, when
 DLP is implemented, it can scan the outbound Emails and track if any 
kind of sensitive or confidential information is being shared.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-140">You can have a rule defined that prevents sharing of 
financial reports or sharing of credit card numbers in an Email or its 
attachments. Without DLP, it is not possible to track such Emails with 
confidential information. However, with DLP implementation in place, as 
the administrator, you can define what type of information can the users
 share.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-141">When you share information with the users within an 
organization, you can set permissions, such as forward or print. For 
example, you send a confidential management decision to your colleague. 
You, however, do not want the colleague to forward or print this Email. 
Such restrictions can be defined in the form of permissions.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-142">The key intent of DLP is to tackle insider threats and
 also to meet the regulation-driven privacy requirements. DLP has three 
key use cases:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-143">

<li id="cn-m5-143"><b>Protect the personal information </b>- DLP is a 
good tool if your organization deals with Personally Identifiable 
Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), or credit card 
information. These types of information are critical and are considered 
highly sensitive. With the help of DLP, this information can be 
protected.</li>

<li id="cn-m5-144"><b>Protect the Intellectual Property (IP) </b>- DLP 
can help an organization protect its IP information. For example, if an 
organization is into developing a unique product, it becomes critical 
for the organization to protect the product-related information. DLP can
 help in implementing protection.</li>

<li id="cn-m5-145"><b>Bring Data Visibility </b>- DLP can help you track
 the information that is being used by the users. For example, you can 
track who is using which information and who is sharing or attempting to
 share information.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m5-146"><b><i>Masking</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-147">Data masking hides data by concealing letters and 
numbers with different characters. After data is concealed, it is masked
 behind the letters and numbers. When an authorized user accesses the 
concealed data, he or she is allowed to access it.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-148"><b><i>Encryption</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-149">In most cases, individuals or organizations store data
 in cleartext format. In such a scenario, if a hacker gets hands on the 
data, it is vulnerable. The hacker can delete, modify, or simply steal 
the data. Data encryption software enhances data security by applying an
 algorithm and converts normal data into encrypted data, which can only 
be read by an authorized individual. If the data is stolen, depending on
 the algorithm used, the encrypted data may just be useless to the 
hacker. To an unauthorized person, the cipher data will be unreadable.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-150">Data can be encrypted in storage and in transit.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-151"><b><i>At rest / In transit / motion / In processing</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-152">Data can be in different stages. There are three key stages of any data that you create or maintain. These stages are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-153">

<li id="cn-m5-153"><b>Data at rest</b>: This type of data is inactive 
and is either in storage or archive. It could be data stored on a hard 
drive, archived or backed up in tapes. For example, a folder with 
several files that have been backed up in a tape drive.</li>

<li id="cn-m5-154"><b>Data in transit/motion</b>: This is the data that 
is travelling over a network from one device to another device, which 
can either be an endpoint, a server, or even a network device. For 
example, if you are sending a file from your system to another system.</li>

<li id="cn-m5-155"><b>Data in use</b>: This type of data is being changed constantly. When you are working on a file on your system, the file is the data in use.</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m5-156">To protect data at any stage, you need to ensure that it is encrypted.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-157"><b><i>Tokenization</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-158">Tokenization is a method of replacing an actual string
 of data with unique identification symbols or numbers. This way if 
anyone gets hold of the string of text, they cannot decipher it. 
Tokenization can be used to protect sensitive information, such as:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-159">

<li id="cn-m5-159">Bank transactions</li>

<li id="cn-m5-160">Medical records</li>

<li id="cn-m5-161">Criminal records</li>

<li id="cn-m5-162">Vehicle driver information</li>

<li id="cn-m5-163">Loan applications</li>

<li id="cn-m5-164">Stock trading</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="cn-m5-165"><b><i>Rights Management</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-166">DRM or Digital Rights Management is mainly used with 
music, e-books, and DVDs. With the use of DRM, the media is protected 
from cracking, reproducing, or tampering. It is up to the creator of the
 media to use DRM. Any violation of DRM can result a lawsuit under the 
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</p>

<h3 id="cn-m5-167"><b>Hardware Security Module (HSM)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-168">Most servers themselves need to perform encryption and
 decryption. However, when a server does this, a certain amount of 
resources are consumed. A Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a piece of 
hardware that is designed to perform cryptographic functions. When you 
connect an HSM to a server, rather than consuming the server resources, 
HSM is used for encryption and decryption. Other than encryption and 
decryption, HSM and can also be used for secure key generation and its 
management.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-169">Some of the key uses of HSM are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-170">

<li id="cn-m5-170">Encryption and decryption for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</li>

<li id="cn-m5-171">ATMs</li>

<li id="cn-m5-172">Banking applications</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m5-173"><b>Geographical Considerations</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-174">Whenever you are establishing a datacenter for your 
organization, you need to consider the geographical locations carefully.
 For example, you would want to ensure that a datacenter is not set 
where hurricanes or floods are common. You have to consider several 
points before putting up a datacenter. Some of the key points are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-175">

<li id="cn-m5-175">Power availability</li>

<li id="cn-m5-176">Internet service provider’s presence</li>

<li id="cn-m5-177">Type of connectivity available</li>

<li id="cn-m5-178">Fiber backbone availability</li>

<li id="cn-m5-179">Locations of the customers</li>

</ul>

<p id="cn-m5-180">You would not put up a datacenter in a location where 
power is a scarcity. It can cost thousands of dollars per month to run 
your organization on power backup systems. Another example is that if 
you are close to the customer, it gives them good throughput and 
connectivity. Closure you are to the customers, less latency issues 
there will be.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m5-181"><b>Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-182">In the simplest terms, a CASB is a mediator between 
the cloud consumer and the cloud service provider. The key role of a 
CASB is to bridge the security gaps from the cloud consumer to the cloud
 service provider, who may be running Software as a Service (SaaS), 
Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). A 
CASB can also extend the organizational security policies into the cloud
 environment and enforce them on cloud components and services as they 
are accessed. Users may be using various types of devices, such as 
laptops or mobile. The same set of security policies, which are applied 
in the on-premises infrastructure, can be extended to a cloud 
infrastructure.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-183">It is a known fact that organizations are quite 
apprehensive about putting their data in the cloud. However, with CASB 
implementation, there are enough security controls and methods that can 
be applied to protect data. With a CASB, you can use a security control,
 such as a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or secure web gateways. Other 
security offerings that a CASB may offer:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-184">

<li id="cn-m5-185">Cloud governance</li>

<li id="cn-m5-186">Risk assessment</li>

<li id="cn-m5-187">Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</li>

<li id="cn-m5-191">Data Encryption</li>

<li id="cn-m5-192">Identity and Access Management (IAM)</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m5-193"><b>Response and Recovery Controls</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-194">There are several types of controls that can be used 
for security purposes. Security controls can be used to detect and 
prevent attacks. They can also be used to respond to a certain incident.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-195">When an incident such as an attack or breach occurs, 
response and recovery controls are used. There are several tasks that 
are included in the response and recovery controls. Some of the key 
tasks are:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-196">

<li id="cn-m5-196">Creating an incident response plan</li>

<li id="cn-m5-197">Informing the required authorities when an incident occurs</li>

<li id="cn-m5-198">Perform the root cause analysis</li>

<li id="cn-m5-199">Implement new security controls or update the existing controls to prevent similar attacks</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m5-200"><b>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-201">A site that is secured with SSL or TLS, it displays a 
padlock in front of the URL in the Web browser’s address bar. For 
example, consider the following exhibit:</p>

<p id="cn-m5-202"></p><figure><img class="cn-img" id="cn-image-m5-c-2" src="EnterpriseNetworkSecurityConfigurationConcepts_files/image-m5-c-2.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1 Screenshot of Microsoft website: Showing the padlock on the www.microsoft.com website."><figcaption>Figure 1.1 Screenshot of Microsoft website: Showing the padlock on the www.microsoft.com website.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p id="cn-m5-204">The SSL/TLS intends to ensure that there is a secure 
and encrypted connection with the webserver. However, the concept of 
SSL/TLS can work against the user. Consider an example in which a user 
clicks on a phishing link to a protected website with the SSL/TLS 
certificate. Since the information is encrypted, none of the security 
controls can inspect traffic to determine whether it is legitimate or 
illegitimate.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-205">SSL/TLS inspection intends to verify the webpage 
content for malicious content. After a user clicks on the phishing link 
to an SSL/TLS-based website, SSL inspection first connects with the 
webserver and verifies the contents of the webpage by decrypting it 
first. After it ensures that there is no malicious content, it allows 
the creation of the SSL/TLS connection to the webserver. The intent is 
to safeguard the sensitive information that is sent to the webserver.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m5-206"><b>Hashing</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-207">Humans have fingerprints that cannot be altered or 
changed. If you tamper with fingerprints, it does not match the original
 one and cannot be considered a match with the original. Hashes are the 
same, and are equatable to fingerprints for files. When you generate a 
hash for a file and change file contents, the hash is no longer valid. 
If you generate a hash, you get a different hash. Hashing is not a 
reversible process, and once a hash is generated, it cannot be reversed.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m5-208"><b>API Considerations</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-209">Application Programming Interface (API) allows two 
applications to connect or access an application's premium features, 
which otherwise would be locked. There can be an issue with an insecure 
application programming interface (API), which could lead to data 
compromise when applications connect to the Internet and communicate 
with other applications. With the API, the applications exchange data 
with each other. To ensure data safety, you must ensure some of the key 
guidelines when using APIs:</p>

<ul id="cn-m5-210">

<li id="cn-m5-210">Ensure that there is strong encryption applied</li>

<li id="cn-m5-211">Ensure that there are proper authentication and authorization</li>

<li id="cn-m5-212">Always use password hash</li>

<li id="cn-m5-213">Ensure that HTTPS is used instead of HTTP</li>

<li id="cn-m5-214">Ensure that timestamps are added to the requests being made via API</li>

<li id="cn-m5-215">Ensure there is input validation on the data being added via API</li>

<li id="cn-m5-216">Ensure that the principle of least privilege is adopted</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m5-217"><b>Site Resiliency</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-218">Consider a network that does not have redundancy. 
Malware attacks the network and brings it down. In such a scenario, it 
would take a few days to get the network up and running. A single 
network site does not have resiliency. To build site resiliency, you can
 use different sites that help you keep your organization going without 
significant downtime.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-219">There are primarily three different types of sites 
that can be used for resiliency. The first one is a hot site, which is a
 replica of the original site. When a disaster strikes on an 
organization's main or original site, it can always fall back on the hot
 site, which has the complete infrastructure and data replicated.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-220">It is possible to make the hot site operational in a 
matter of a few hours. An organization has to put in much money to set 
up the hot site to replace the original site.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-221">The second type of site is a warm site. It is a 
partial replica of the original site. An organization may take a few 
days to get the site up and running. Unlike the hot site, the warm site 
does not have complete data replicated and does not have a complete 
infrastructure.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-222">The third type of site is a cold site with the bare 
minimum infrastructure, and it takes a longer time to make this site 
operational. The organization may have to bring in servers and endpoints
 and make necessary arrangements for Internet connectivity. This type of
 site takes the longest time to be operational.</p>

<h3 id="cn-m5-223"><b>Deception and Disruption</b></h3>

<p id="cn-m5-224">To safeguard a network, you may have to create a 
diversion for the attacker. The attacker is lured away from the actual 
network to one or more systems set as open systems in the diversion. 
This method is called deception. You want to deceive the attacker from 
getting into the organization’s network.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-225">An attacker gets into a network because he or she 
wants to cause some disruption, either bringing down the network, taking
 control of servers or simply stealing data.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-226">To save a network from a disruption, you can use several methods, out of which using a honeypot is one such method.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-227"><b><i>Honeypots, Honeyfiles, Honeynets</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-228">Without getting to know what an attacker does, it is 
difficult to understand their methodologies. Honeypots are installed to 
understand the attacker’s methodologies. Along with this, a honeypot is a
 server that has several data files, which are known as <b>honeyfiles</b>.
 These files are real looking files with some data in them, but the data
 does not hold any value. These files are meant to attract an attacker.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-229">Honeypots look like real servers. An attacker cannot 
tell the difference, whether it is a honeypot or a real server. The idea
 is to create deception to make the attacker believe that it is a real 
server.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-230">Honeypots and honeynets attempt to divert attackers 
from live networks. They allow security personnel to observe current 
methodologies used in attacks and gather intelligence on these attacks.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-231">In most cases, an organization installs one honeypot 
server. However, it is also possible to put more than one honeypot 
together and form a honeynet network. A honeynet mimics a real network 
and contains several honeypots. A honeynet's purpose is the same as the 
honeypot - save the real network and understand an attacker’s 
methodologies.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-232"><b><i>Fake Telemetry</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-233">You would often deploy deception controls, such as a 
honeypot or honeynet, on your network. Fake telemetry, which is also 
known as deception telemetry, is the act of collecting information from 
deception controls. Consider a scenario that you receive an alert from 
the honeypot that is deployed on the network. After you receive the 
alert, you know that someone is already inside the honeypot or is 
attempting a connection. Based on the information received, you have to 
decide on the next steps that need to be performed.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-234">For example, an attacker may have already started to 
explore data within the honeypot. You have to decide whether you want to
 mitigate or simply monitor the attacker. The fake telemetry data can 
help you with such decisions by putting in automated security controls, 
which may divert an attacker from a real system to a decoy or honeypot. 
You can even block IP addresses from where an attack originated in the 
firewall.</p>

<h4 id="cn-m5-235"><b><i>DNS Sinkhole</i></b></h4>

<p id="cn-m5-236">A DNS sinkhole is also known as a blackhole DNS. It is
 used to prevent access to the malicious URL or any URL that the network
 administrator does not want you to access. Consider a scenario in which
 you receive a phishing Email and accidentally click on the malicious 
URL or link in it. You would take to a malicious website in the normal 
scenario, and perhaps malware gets downloaded to your system.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-237">DNS sinkhole protects such a malicious link or URL. 
The network administrator can create a record in the DNS server and map 
the malicious URL to a fake IP address, which can even display a custom 
webpage showing the access to the URL is denied.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-238">In an enterprise scenario, the firewall and the proxy 
server are supposed to be the first defense line and protect from 
malicious and unwanted URLs. However, if they fail to do the job, the 
DNS sinkhole can be the second defense line.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-242">A honey pot is a decoy or a trap created by 
organizations to attract hackers into a computer system. One of the main
 objectives of using a honeypot is to monitor the hacker exploit the 
system's vulnerabilities, then subsequently learn the weaknesses of the 
system and apply the necessary security measures to strengthen it from 
future attacks. Another objective is to study the hacker’s methodology. 
The final objective is to divert the hacker’s attention from the main 
network to the decoy system.</p>

<p id="cn-m5-257">Pentbox is an application that can be configured as a 
honeypot. Penetration testers mainly use it as it has various tools 
available. Pentbox is written in Ruby language and installed on various 
operating systems, such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The only 
pre-requisite for its installation is that it requires the Ruby package.
